Version: 6.0.2
Released: 11th December, 2009

Bugs Fixed:
  - Add fix for notice in survey addon permissions.
  - Fix issue where hourly limits were not being throttled and were showing a notice saying the user has gone over their limit. Emails are not throttled to the specified hourly rate on the group.
  - Fix a potential issue in autoloading function when class is checked for existence. Since the default behavior of class_exists is to autoload, the second parameter needed to be set to false so that the class isn't attempted to be autoloaded.
  - Fix when exporting contacts where the filtering options weren't working properly and always took the user to the filter page.
  - Simplify UI on contact exporting page. Instead of 2 radio buttons, there is now a single checkbox that shows the option to either filter or not. Bey default, filtering is disabled.

NOTES
-----
Autoresponder now have a "paused" status which have the same behaviour as the old "inactive" status.
An autoresponder can be "Active" and "Paused" at the same time.

Inactive (ie. Not active): Subscribers data will NOT be captured and queued as a recipient.
As a result, contacts added/subscribed when autoresponder is inactive will NOT receive the autoresponder
when the autoresponder get reactivated.

Paused: Autoresponder will continue collecting subscribers data and queue them as a recipient.
As a result, when the autoresponder is resumed, contacts that were added during the
period when autoresponder is paused will still receive the autoresponder when the autoresponder is "resumed".

20th April, 2009

Note
----
We have identified a problem with MySQL servers where some customers' connections to their database are using the 'latin1' character set by default.
As a result, data fails to be stored as UTF-8. Rather, it is stored as garbled characters in the database that can be interpreted correctly
when queried using a 'latin1' connection. Using a 'latin1' (also known as 'ISO-8859-1') character set has a number of drawbacks and should be avoided.

At present we do not have a solution for detecting corrupted data automatically (which is why we are unable to create an automatic upgrade for it).
If you find you have problems with garbled contents when using special/non-standard characters, there will be a script in the customer-to-customer forum that will allow you to fix it:
http://anonym.to/?http://www.interspire.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=197

Bugs Fixed
----------
Fix clients using IPv6 being unable to login.
Fix display of checkbox data for unsubscribe emails sent to list owners.
Fix performance degredation caused by multiple entries in the user_access table.
Fix pop-up window header used when adding folders to be language-packed.
Fix using wildcards to match the start or end of an email address in a segment rule.
Fixed incorrect splittest scheduling.
Fixed permission issue where user was not able to view/edit/delete their own contacts in some cases.
Fixed the undefined variables on contact list statistics.
Fixed MySQL connection character set for new installs (see note above).
PostgreSQL users were not able to specify their own custom port.
Upgrading from SendStudio 2004 was failing on one of the upgrades.

CREATE INDEX <TABLEPREFIX>stats_linkclicks_statid_clicktime_idx ON <TABLEPREFIX>stats_linkclicks(statid, clicktime);

*****************************************
*    Changelog for SendStudio NX 1.1.0  *
*****************************************

17th May, 2007
--------------
***************************************************
******************* PLEASE READ *******************
***************************************************
* Unfortunately due to the way character sets were previously handled, all files in SendStudio NX have been changed.
* This fixes non-English character sets (eg Chinese, Japanese, Arabic).
*
* The default character set will be changed to "UTF-8" if it is not currently set to "Western Alphabet (ISO-8859-1)".
*
* Before you start, remove the sendstudio/admin/resources/email_templates folder.
* The templates have been re-organised into subfolders, so if you don't clean them out first you will end up with duplicates.
* If you have purchased a template pack, you will need to re-upload your other templates.
***************************************************

All files will need updating in the following folders:

- /sendstudio/admin/functions/* (AND ALL SUBFOLDERS).
- /sendstudio/admin/cron/*
- /sendstudio/admin/resources (EXCEPT the admin/resources/user_bounce_rules.php file)
- /sendstudio/*.php

Specific Language File Changes
------------------------------
/sendstudio/admin/language/language.php
/sendstudio/admin/language/templates.php
/sendstudio/admin/language/timezones.php
/sendstudio/admin/language/settings.php
/sendstudio/admin/language/charactersets.php
/sendstudio/admin/language/newsletters.php
/sendstudio/admin/language/users.php
/sendstudio/admin/language/forms.php
/sendstudio/admin/language/stats.php
/sendstudio/admin/language/bounce.php

Specific Template File Changes
------------------------------
/sendstudio/admin/includes/templates/settings.tpl
/sendstudio/admin/includes/templates/send_step3.tpl
/sendstudio/admin/includes/templates/autoresponder_form_step3.tpl
/sendstudio/admin/includes/templates/form_form_step1.tpl
/sendstudio/admin/includes/templates/user_form.tpl

/sendstudio/admin/includes/templates/templates_builtin_manage.tpl
/sendstudio/admin/includes/templates/templates_builtin_manage_row.tpl

** new file **
/sendstudio/admin/includes/templates/templates_builtin_manage_cell.tpl


Stylesheet Changes
------------------
admin/includes/styles/stylesheet.css

Added Features
--------------
- Can set default bounce information on the Settings page for when you create a new mailing list

- Reorganise settings page to make it easier to follow

- 3 new user permissions
-- Allow or disallow a user to be able to see smtp information in their "My Account" settings
-- Allow or disallow a user to see "Built In Templates"
-- Allow or disallow a user to see "Bounce Information" when they create or edit a mailing list


These are all *OFF* by default (the user does *NOT* have access to these features).
To allow access, edit their user account and tick the appropriate permissions.


- Show email credits left for a user if applicable under the time information on the top right corner.

Other Fixes
-----------
-- Modify details forms were not pre-filling some custom field options.

If you have a modify details form with:
- date boxes
- captcha
- checkboxes

you will need to regenerate the html.

To do this, edit the appropriate form, untick an option and retick it.
You will get a warning about the contents being changed, hit "YES" and edit the new html.

-- More bounce rules
/sendstudio/admin/resources/bounce_rules.php
