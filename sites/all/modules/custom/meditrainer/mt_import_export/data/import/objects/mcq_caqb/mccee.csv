On examination, seven cafÃ©-au-lait spots on his body, as well as two small, soft masses above his orbit, are seen. He also has axillary freckling. His mother also has cafÃ©-au-lait spots on her arms. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ",Congenital hypothyroidism,Marfan syndrome,Neurofibromatosis,Osteogenesis imperfecta,Tuberous sclerosis,,3,"Neurofibromatosis is a multisystem genetic disorder. The features of this condition are more than six cafÃ©-au-lait spots, two or more neurofibromas, axillary freckling, optic gliomas, iris hamartomas (Lisch nodules), and osseous lesions. There is almost always a first-degree relative with neurofibromatosis. Congenital hypothyroidism is associated with poor feeding, an enlarged fontanelle, an enlarged tongue, and an umbilical hernia in the neonatal period. It would not go undetected until 8 years of age. Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder characterized by long fingers, hypermobile joints, subluxation of the lenses, pectus carinatum, and aortic aneurysms. Osteogenesis imperfecta is a rare connective tissue disease characterized by recurrent fractures, blue sclera, thin skin, and hyperextensibility of ligaments. Tuberous sclerosis is associated with facial angiofibromas (adenoma sebaceum), retinal hamartomas, seizures, and mental retardation. Seizures are the most common presenting symptom. It is an autosomal-dominant inherited disease.",,

74,3,PMCH,If the threshold of a screening test is increased. How it will affect sensitivity and specificity? ,Sensitivity increase  specificity decrease,Sensitivity decrease and specificity increase,Both sensitivity and specificity increase,Both sensitivity and specificity decrease,,q71.jpg|q7b1.jpg,2,"In the classic model above. The definitions are as follows:Sensitivity = a/(a+c) which is the true positive rate. Meaning of all the people with the disease the portion that will actually test positive.Specificity = d/(b+d) which is the true negative rate. Meaning of all the people without the disease the portion that will actually test negative.A real world example will clearly explain that will happen if the threshold is increased. Say we are testing people for diabetes. We are using our current random blood sugar value of 200 and a threshold for a positive test. We test 40 people. See the model, where the black circles represent normal people and the red are those with diabetes. Then we test again using a threshold value of 250 for random blood sugar.

76,5,Psychiatry,A nurse has been to the ER with repeated attacks of hypoglycemia. Her stories are inconsistent and she also wishes to be admitted each time. Further investigation reveals she has an increased serum insulin but low serum C-peptide. Appropriate management at this time would be ,Growth Hormone test,GTT (glucose tolerance test),Psychiatric assessment,B-HCG,CT of Pancreas,,3,"Insulin pushes glucose into the cells and high quantities of insulin can cause hypoglycemia and symptoms associated with it like sweating, intense hunger, trembling, weakness and palpitations. If the increased insulin in her body was endogenous then the C-Peptide would be high when tested. Insulinomas (tumors of the pancreas) can cause this.C-peptide is a by-product in insulin biosynthesis, produced at the same rate. So when insulin is high as a result of endogenous production, C-Peptide will be also. Since her C-Peptide level is low. This means her insulin has come from an exogenous source.Since she is a nurse and her stories are inconsistent she is likely injecting herself with insulin she has obtained at her job to fake symptoms. This now becomes a psychiatric/social issue and warrants a psychiatric assessment via consult.",,

On physical examination, there is marked swelling and tenderness over her anterior tibial tuberosity. A radiograph of her left knee reveals irregularities of the tubercle contour and haziness of the adjacent metaphyseal border. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for her symptoms?  ",Avascular necrosis of the hip,Legg-Calve-Perthes disease,Osgood-Schlatter disease,Septic arthritis,Slipped capital femoral epiphysis,,3,"Osgood-Schlatter disease is a common cause of anterior knee pain in the adolescent. It is a stress reaction of the insertion of the patella tendon into the tibia tubercle. The condition previously was more common in adolescent boys near the time of their growth spurt; however, girls are being seen more frequently with this diagnosis owing to more active sports participation. There can be some fragmentation of the ossicles of the developing tibia tubercle or soft tissue involvement of the patella tendon insertion without obvious bony changes. Often there is only a tendonitis of the patella tendon insertion and inflammation of the deep infrapatellar bursa. Clinically, a young teenager who is quite active in sports will complain of pain and swelling over the tibial tubercle. The condition may be unilateral or bilateral. On examination, there is an obviously swollen, tender, and occasionally warm area over the tibia tubercle. The radiograph can be normal or show fragmentation of the area of patella tendon insertion. The natural history of untreated Osgood-Schlatter disease is relatively benign, if allowed to heal and complications are avoided. Since unusual stress at a time of rapid growth is occurring, limiting the offending sports activity is usually sufficient to relieve the symptoms. Kneeling and squatting should be limited. Physical therapy is occasionally used if there is unusual hamstring tightness.",,

Diuretics may be prescribed to help the kidneys excrete excess sodium and water and to treat high blood pressure. For rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, drugs to suppress the immune system are started promptly. High doses of corticosteroids are usually given intravenously.Agents useful in treating hypertension include calcium channel blockers and nitroprusside. Note that beta-blocking agents or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors administered alone may not be useful unless administered with vasodilators and diuretics, because plasma renin activity levels are reduced.

Approximately 65% of vegetarians (diets that included milk and eggs) were also deficient. Only 5% of those who consumed meats had vitamin B12 deficiency. B12 is not found in any plant food other than fortified cereals. It is, however, abundant in many meats and fish, and in smaller amounts in milk and eggs. This makes it difficult for people following a strict vegetarian diet to get the necessary amount of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 deficiency leads to anemia. Symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency, which usually come on gradually, include fatigue, weakness, nausea, and constipation. Long-term and severe vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to nerve changes such as numbness, tingling in the hands and feet, balance and memory problems, and depression.",,

This can be caused by H. pylori infections, excessive acid production in the stomach and long term use of the NSAID class of drugs which include aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen.Symptoms of gastric ulcers that patients will present with are pain, heartburn, early satiety and sometimes bloating and vomiting. Diagnoses is made by doing an EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) to visualize the ulcer. A biopsy can be taken at the time also.Treatment options include medicines that reduce the amount of acid that your stomach makes. H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are commonly used for this. They usually help people start to feel better within 3 days. PPIs taken daily or twice-daily doses for 4 weeks heal 80-100% of gastric ulcers if H pylori infection is not present or has been eradicated.All H2 blockers are comparable in efficacy and, when used in twice-daily doses for a period of 8 weeks, have a healing rate of higher than 70%.If healing of gastric ulcer is not achieved despite repeat treatment, maintenance antisecretory therapy should be recommended.Instruct patients to avoid NSAIDs.Discourage alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking because these activities impair gastric mucosal protection.",,

This can lead to many sympathetic nervous system symptoms like elevated blood pressure, palpitations, anxiety, diaphoresis, headaches, weight loss. These symptoms happen is spurts or paroxysms.Diagnoses is made by measuring the level of the catecholamines and their breakdown products or metabolites which are called metanephrines in a 24 hour urine collection. Treatment involves medicines to control the blood pressure and surgery to remove the tumor. (Metanephrine levels are considered the most sensitive and specific test for a pheochromocytoma, while vanillylmandelic acid is the least specific test and has a false-positive rate greater than 15%.)Recall the MEN syndromes. MEN (Multiple endocrine neoplasia) has three types:MEN I (Wermer syndrome) - tumors of the pancreas, pituitary and parathyroid.MEN IIa (Sipple syndrome) - medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromcytoma and tumor of the parathyroid.MEN IIb - Medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma and neuromas.This patient could have MEN II if you consider his family history.",,

Turner syndrome only occurs in females. A normal female will be 46XX and a normal male is 46XY. Turner syndrome patients are 45XO. Genotype is the internally coded, inheritable information carried by all living organisms. This stored information is used as a blueprint or set of instructions for building and maintaining a living creature. Since a male has one Y chromosome, this patient is not genotypically male but is genotypically female.Phenotype is the outward, physical manifestation of the organism. These are the physical parts, for example gender, hair color or anything that is part of the observable structure, function or behavior of a living organism. This patient has only one X chromosome and therefore is phenotypically female.Mosaicism is a condition in which tissues of genetically different types occur in the same organism. For example in a person with mosaic Turner Syndrome, some cells have the normal number of 46 chromosomes, but other cells are missing one X or there are structural defects in the second X.

Which therapy is the most appropriate in this stage of his Parkinsonism? ,Carbidopa/Levodopa (Sinemet),Reserpine,Benztropine,Amantidine,,,4,"Five stages of Parkinson exist. This patient is in stage 1.Stage 1: Patient usually experiences mild symptoms. These symptoms may inconvenience daily tasks the patient would otherwise complete with ease. Typically these symptoms will include the presence of tremors.Stage 2: Symptoms are bilateral, affecting both limbs and both sides of the body. The patient usually encounters problems walking or maintaining balance, and the inability to complete normal physical tasks becomes more apparent.Stage 3: Symptoms can be rather severe and include the inability to walk straight or to stand. There is a noticeable slowing of physical movements.Stage 4: Walking may still occur, but it is often limited and rigidity and bradykinesia are often visible. During this stage, most patients are unable to complete day-to-day tasks, and usually cannot live on their own. Stage 5: This stage takes over the patients physical movements. The patient is usually unable to take care of himself or herself and may not be able to stand or walk during this stage, usually requiring constant one-on-one nursing care.Levodopa and carbidopa have been considered the gold standard drug therapy for Parkinson's disease. Levodopa is started at the onset of moderate symptoms.Treatment of early PD includes : DA agonists, amantadine, MAOI.Amantadine is an antiviral agent that causes increased dopamine in the brain. It is prescribed to provide relief of mild, early-stage Parkinson's disease. Amantadine may also be added to carbidopa-levodopa therapy for people in the latter stages of Parkinson's disease, especially if they have problems with involuntary movements. Amantadine by itself has very few side effects. At the onset of mild symptoms Amantadine is used.",,

What is the most likely diagnosis?  ,Intestinal ischemia,Cecal volvulus,Diverticulitis,Appendicitis,Colon cancer,,1,"Acute mesenteric ischemia is a sudden blockage of blood flow to part of the intestines, which may lead to gangrene and perforation (puncture). At first, the person has severe abdominal pain, usually developing suddenly, but the abdomen is only slightly tender when the doctor presses it. This pain out of proportion to tenderness is a very important clue in the diagnosis.It can be caused by an arterial embolism, which is a blood clot or piece of atherosclerotic plaque material that travels from its origin in the heart or aorta to lodge in the smaller arteries that supply blood to the intestines. If the person has typical presentation, he/she will be taken right to surgery. At surgery, the blood vessel blockage can sometimes be removed or bypassed but sometimes the affected intestine must be removed.Cecal volvulus would present as pain in the right lower quadrant. Diverticulitis presents most commonly in elderly patients as pain in the left lower quadrant, both in the history and during physical exam.Appendicitis would be the right lower quadrant and would elicit tenderness to palpation, in particular at Mcburney's point.

What is the most appropriate management? ,Intermittent prophylactic antibiotic,Continuous prophylactic antibiotic,Observation,Surgery,,q77.jpg,2,"Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is the backup of urine from the organ that stores urine (bladder) into the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder (ureter) during urination. VUR may result in urine reflux into the renal pelvis, causing distention (hydronephrosis) and kidney damage. In children, this condition is usually caused by an abnormality that is present at birth (congenital) and is often diagnosed during prenatal ultrasound.Reflux is graded according to its severity: Grade I results in urine reflux into the ureter only. Grade II results in urine reflux into the ureter and the renal pelvis, without distention (hydronephrosis). See picture below:Grade III results in urine reflux into the ureter and the renal pelvis, causing mild hydronephrosis. Grade IV results in moderate hydronephrosis. Grade V results in severe hydronephrosis and twisting of the ureter. Since many children will outgrow their reflux, they can be followed carefully, with their reflux monitored at intervals by tests such as VCUG, renal ultrasound, or nuclear voiding cystogram. All children aged 1-5 years with reflux grades I-IV should be treated initially with continuous prophylactic antibiotics.",,

A relatively simple, accurate blood test that detects antibodies to HIV (ELISA test) is used to screen people for HIV infection. If the ELISA result is positive, it is confirmed with a more accurate test, usually the Western Blot. Both tests often are not positive in the first month or two after HIV infection because it takes the body that long to produce antibodies against the virus. However, all infants born to HIV infected mothers have positive ELISA tests because of circulating maternal anti-HIV antibodies which disappear by 18 months; early diagnosis is made by detection of HIV RNA in plasma.",,

The difference between the two types is in how the study is actually conducted. An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation may have modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation. Instead data are gathered and correlations between predictors and the response are investigated.An example of an experimental study is the famous Hawthorne studies which attempted to test changes to the working environment at the Hawthorne plant of the Western Electric Company. The researchers were interested in whether increased illumination would increase the productivity of the assembly line workers. The researchers first measured productivity in the plant then modified the illumination in an area of the plant to see if changes in illumination would affect productivity. As it turns out, productivity improved under all the experimental conditions (see Hawthorne effect).An example of an observational study is a study which explores the correlation between smoking and lung cancer. This type of study typically uses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest and then perform statistical analysis. In this case, the researchers would collect observations of both smokers and non-smokers, perhaps through a case-control study, and then look at the number of cases of lung cancer in each group.",,

At the core of the behavior therapy program is a technique known as exposure and ritual prevention (ERP). ERP is based on the process of habituation, in which individuals habituate to stimuli they don't like. We all experience this process in our daily lives. An example would be jumping into cold water. The water feels cold initially, but gradually feels warmer as our body becomes habituated to it. A person can become habituated to smells, sounds, physical sensations, and emotions. In persons with anxiety related to OCD, habituation is a decrease in anxiety that occurs with the simple passage of time. During cognitive therapy/restructuring, the therapist tries to identify and correct errors in the patient's thinking that generate anxiety. Patients with OCD usually have 2 types of erroneous thinking. One is a probability overestimation error, in which they overestimate the probability of a bad event, such as becoming infected with HIV by touching a doorknob. The second is a catastrophe error, in which the patient magnifies the severity of a likely event, such as observing someone using the toilet and not washing his hands. Persons with OCD can best learn to identify and self-correct these errors in thought by going through a series of steps that we call &ldquo;thought challenging.&rdquo;",,

Because delirium is a temporary condition, determining how many people have it is difficult. Delirium, which is usually a sign of a newly developed disorder, affects about one third of hospitalized people aged 70 or older.Being in the hospital can also contribute to or trigger delirium. About 10 to 20% of older people develop delirium while they are in the hospital. Delirium is also very common after surgery, probably because of the stress of surgery, the anesthetics used during surgery, and the analgesics used after surgery. Delirium usually begins suddenly and progresses over hours or days. The actions of people with delirium vary but roughly resemble those of a person who is becoming progressively more intoxicated.The hallmark of delirium is an inability to pay attention. People with delirium cannot concentrate, so they have trouble processing new information and cannot recall recent events. People with delirium may be frightened by bizarre visual hallucinations, seeing things or people that are not there. Some people develop paranoia or have delusions (false beliefs usually involving a misinterpretation of perceptions or experiences).",,

173,4,Pediatrics,"A 9 year old child is studying in kindergarten, is unable to read, write or even to color a picture. He becomes happy when he answers simple questions. What is the most likely diagnosis? ",Autism,Mental retardation,Specific learning disability,Normal child,,,2,"Kindergarden is usually for children aged 4-6. So a 9 year old in kindergarden would not be considered normal. Also the fact that this child is unable to advance into a higher grade more appropriate for his age suggests that he has a global learning disability rather than a specific one for say math, reading or drawing/coloring. We now turn our attention to a) autism vs b) mental retardation. a) Autism is a disorder in which a young child cannot develop normal social relationships, uses language abnormally or not at all, behaves in compulsive and ritualistic ways, and may fail to develop normal intelligence. Autistic children develop symptoms in at least 3 of the following areas: social relationships, language, behavior, and sometimes intelligence. About 50% of autistic children never learn to speak. Those who learn do so much later than normal and use words in an unusual way. These children rarely have an interactive dialogue with others. Autistic children often speak with an unusual rhythm and pitch. About 70% of children with autism have some degree of mental retardation (an IQ less than 70). Their performance is uneven, they usually do better on tests of motor and spatial skills than on verbal tests. b) Mental retardation is characterized by significantly subaverage intellectual functioning (often expressed as an intelligence quotient  70 to 75) combined with limitations of  2 of the following: communication, self-direction, social skills, self-care, use of community resources, and maintenance of personal safety. Delayed development is usually apparent by preschool age. Among older children, hallmark features are a low IQ combined with limitations in adaptive behavior skills. Although developmental patterns may vary, it is much more common for children with MR to experience slow progress than developmental arrest.Behavioral disorders include lack of socially responsible behavior, impaired ability to communicate, and discomfort from coexisting physical problems and mental health disorders such as depression or anxiety. In comparing autism and mental retardation, the question best fits the latter.",,

Examples of organophosphates include: insecticides, nerve gases and herbicides. Nerve agents have also been used in battle, notably in Iraq in the 1980s. Additionally, chemical weapons still pose a very real concern in this age of terrorist activity.The primary mechanism of action of organophosphate pesticides is inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). AChE is an enzyme that degrades the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) into choline and acetic acid. ACh is found in the central and peripheral nervous system, neuromuscular junctions, and red blood cells (RBCs).Organophosphates inactivate AChE by phosphorylating the serine hydroxyl group located at the active site of AChE. This leads to an increase in the amount of Acetylcholine in the body and a wide variety of reactions.",,

Symptoms do not develop until organ damage, often irreversible, develops. Symptoms include fatigue, hepatomegaly, bronze skin pigmentation, loss of libido, arthalgias, and manifestations of cirrhosis, diabetes, or cardiomyopathy. 90% of patients will present with excessive skin pigmentation. Diagnostic testing will reveal that the serum iron is increased ( 300 mg/dL). Phlebotomy is the simplest method of excess iron removal in most cases.The other choices would not typically present with dark skin pigmentation.",,
192,4,Pediatrics,Which of the following is not used in the treatment of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis?  ,Methotrexate,Steroids,Physiotherapy,Multivitamins,Analgesics,jra.gif,4,"Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis pain can develop in kids aged 1-16 years of age. Common presentations include swelling, red and warm joints. The knee and wrist joints are the most commonly affected. Initial lab workup involves: CBC, ESR, RF and ANA.Treatment is with a combination of medication, physical therapy, and exercise. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), like ibuprofen are used most commonly.Except for severe systemic disease, systemic corticosteroids can usually be avoided. When necessary, the lowest possible dose is used (eg, oral prednisone)Methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine are useful DMARDs for polyarticular disease. Physical therapy, exercises, splints, and other supportive measures help prevent flexion contractures.",,
193,4,Pediatrics,A 3 year old child presents with stridor and drooling. He is diagnosed with epiglottitis. What is the most appropriate immediate management? ,Intubation,Antibiotics,Tracheostomy,X-Ray,,,1,"Epiglottitis is a rapidly progressive bacterial infection of the epiglottis and surrounding tissues that may lead to sudden respiratory obstruction and death. Symptoms include severe sore throat, dysphagia, high fever, drooling, and inspiratory stridor. Diagnosis requires direct visualization of the supraglottic structures, which is not to be performed until full respiratory support is available. In children, the airway must be secured immediately, preferably by nasotracheal intubation. An endotracheal tube is usually required until the patient has been stabilized for 24 to 48 h (usual total intubation time is  60 h).A beta-lactamase resistant antibiotic, such as ceftriaxone should be used empirically, pending culture and sensitivity test results. Epiglottitis is caused by H. influenzae type B can be effectively prevented with the H. influenzae type B (Hib) conjugate vaccine.",,
194,3,PMCH,What is the appropriate prophylaxis for contacts of someone who has developed a meningococcus infection?,Vancomycin,Ampicillin,Rifampin,Penicillin,,,3,"Meningococcal diseases are infections caused by a bacterium named Neisseria meningitidis (also called the meningococcus). Meningococcal disease includes serious infections of the fluid and lining surrounding the brain (meningitis), bloodstream (bacteremia and sepsis), lungs (pneumonia), and joints (arthritis).Symptoms include sudden high fever (usually 102 F or more), chills, severe headache, difficulty breathing, stiff neck and back, painful joints and vomiting. Antibiotics, such as penicillin G or ceftriaxone, can be used to treat people with meningococcal disease.The bacteria is present in the noses and throats of ill persons and is spread to close contacts through saliva or nose and throat secretions when talking, coughing, sneezing, kissing, etc. Close contacts of people with meningococcal disease are at increased risk for acquiring disease and should receive a prophylactic antibiotic. Options include rifampin and ceftriaxone.",,
195,6,Surgery,The most common cause of a Fistula-inano is,Rectal abscess,Anal fissure,Carcinoma,Radiation,,q127.jpg,1,"An anorectal fistula is a tubelike tract with one opening in the anal canal and the other usually in the perianal skin. See picture:Fistula-in-ano is nearly always caused by a previous anorectal/perirectal abscess. Anal canal glands situated at the dentate line afford a path for infecting organisms to reach the intramuscular spaces.Other fistulae develop secondary to trauma, Crohn disease, anal fissures, carcinoma, radiation therapy, actinomycoses, tuberculosis, and chlamydial infections.A history of recurrent abscess followed by intermittent or constant discharge is usual. Discharge material is purulent, serosanguineous, or both. Pain may be present if there is infection. On inspection, one or more secondary openings can be seen. A cordlike tract can often be palpated. Diagnosis is by examination. Sigmoidoscopy should follow. Treatment is via surgery.",,
196,6,Surgery,"A 58 year old man complains of bleeding during defecation. When you try to examine his anus, it is so painful for him that you cannot proceed with the rectal examination. What is the most likely cause?  ",Thrombosed internal piles,Thrombosed external piles,Anal fissure,Constipation,,q128.jpg,3,"An anal fissure is an acute longitudinal tear or a chronic ovoid ulcer in the squamous epithelium of the anal canal. It causes severe pain, sometimes with bleeding, particularly with defecation. Anal fissures are believed to result from laceration by a hard or large stool, with secondary infection. Trauma (eg, anal intercourse) is a rare cause. Fissures cause severe pain and bleeding. The pain typically occurs with or shortly after defecation, lasts for several hours, and subsides until the next bowel movement. Examination must be very gentle but with adequate spreading of the buttocks to allow visualization.Diagnosis is made by inspection. Treatment is with stool softeners, sitz baths and nitroglycerin ointments. When conservative measures fail, surgery (internal anal sphincterotomy or controlled anal dilation) is needed to interfere with the cycle of internal anal sphincter spasm. Piles (hemorrhoids) are painful but usually examination is possible. Constipation is unlikely to have this presentation.",,
197,6,Surgery,A 14 year old boy fractures his leg. After several hours in a cast he develops pain on passive extension. What is the most likely cause? ,Compartment syndrome,Carpal tunnel syndrome,Re-fracture,Growing pains,,,1,"Compartment syndrome is increased tissue pressure within a closed fascial space, resulting in tissue ischemia. The earliest symptom is pain out of proportion to the severity of injury. Common causes include fractures and severe contusions. Compartment syndrome usually occurs in the anterior lower leg. The earliest symptom is worsening pain. It is typically out of proportion to the severity of the apparent injury and is exacerbated by passive stretching of the muscles within the compartment. Pain, one of the 5 P's of tissue ischemia, is followed by the other 4: paresthesias, paralysis, pallor, and pulselessness. Diagnosis is by measuring compartmental pressure (normal &le; 20 mm Hg), usually with a commercially available wick catheter. Pressures of 20 to 40 mm Hg can sometimes be treated conservatively with analgesics, elevation, and splinting. Casts, if present, are removed or bivalved. Pressures &gt; 40 mm Hg usually require immediate fasciotomy to relieve pressure. If necrosis occurs, amputation may be needed.",,

Other clostridia species responsible for the condition include Clostridium novyi (40%), Clostridium septicum (20%), Clostridium histolyticum (10%), Clostridium bifermentans (10%), and Clostridium fallax (5%)]Clostridium infection of a wound is an emergency as it can lead to rapid onset of myonecrosis with muscle swelling, severe pain, gas production, and sepsis. Generally the treatment is a combination of antibiotics, surgery, and hyperbaric oxygen. Surgical treatment is with wide debridement of necrotic muscle.",,
199,6,Surgery,"On the 11th postoperative day following a radical prostatectomy for adenocarcinoma of the prostate, a 70 year old man is recovering uneventfully. He then ambulates to the bathroom, but upon returning to his bed he suddenly becomes extremely dyspneic and diaphoretic, with chest pain, palpitations, and a feeling of panic. Which of the following post-operative complications has he most likely developed?  ",Pulmonary edema,Pleural effusion,Atelectasis,Thromboembolus,Diffuse alveolar damage,,4,"The formation of a thrombus (blood clot) is usually caused by the top three causes, known as Virchow's triad (Edothelial damage, stasis and hypercoagulability). To elaborate, the pathogenesis includes: an injury to the vessel's wall (such as by trauma, infection, or turbulent flow at bifurcations); by the slowing or stagnation of blood flow past the point of injury (which may occur after long periods of sendentary behavior - for example, sitting on a long airplane flight); by a blood state of hypercoagulability (caused for example, by genetic deficiencies or autoimmune disorders).An embolism is a thrombus that moves and travels to a different area. In this patient it has traveled to the lungs causing his symptoms. This patient has at least two of the three strong risk factors for developing this thromboembolic occurrence. He was bed ridden for at least a few days post-op and he has had recent surgery causing trauma and endothelial damage.",,
200,1,Medicine,A 50 year old man develops hematuria. He is found to have a mass in the kidney which has an increased blood supply. What is the most likely cause? ,Medication side effect,Infection,Nephrolithiasis,Renal cell carcinoma,,,4,"Renal cell carcinoma is the most common renal cancer. Symptoms appear late and include hematuria, flank pain, a palpable mass, and fever. Diagnosis is by CT or MRI and occasionally by biopsy. Treatment is with surgery. Infection, stones and drugs are all causes of hematuria, but are unlikely to show a mass with increased blood supply.",,
201,4,Pediatrics,What is the condition most commonly mistaken for appendicitis in children? ,Mesenteric lymphadenitis,Meckels diverticulum,Intussussception,Constipation,,,1,"Mesenteric lymphadenitis is an inflammation of the lymph nodes on the wall of the mesentery (the covering of the intestines). It is often a childhood illness, though occasionally seen in adults. It is a very common cause of abdominal pain in children, mimicking appendicitis, and often difficult to differentiate from appendicitis. It is estimated that 1 in 5 children diagnosed with appendicitis actually have mesenteric lymphadenitis.The main symptom is abdominal pain. This is often located in the right lower abdomen or right iliac fossa. It is a colicky abdominal pain which just resolves momentarily without any intervention. The sufferer, usually a child, may be completely pain free between attacks. Characteristically, the pain moves from one spot to the other on the abdomen, in keeping with the movement of the bowel loops in the abdominal cavity. Asking the child to turn to the left side will demonstrate this shift as the area of pain and tenderness will move along with the bowel to the left. In appendicitis, the pain may initially start around the umbilicus, then moves over to the right iliac fossa. Once it settles there, it does not move around any longer.",,
202,1,Medicine,"A patient with flank pain has an intravenous urography (IVU), which show the calyces of the kidney are seen blunted. Dye excretion is delayed in the affected kidney. A 2-3mm stone is seen in the pelvis in the lower 1/3rd of the ureter. What is the appropriate management? ",Analgesics and hydration,Lithotripsy,Percutaneous stone removal,Remove the stone by retrograde cystoscopy,,,1,"A ureteral stone can cause severe abdominal pain, which will radiate to the corresponding flank region. Diagnosis is made by imaging with a CT or Plain x-ray or as in this case, an IVU. Small stones (less than 5mm) may pass on their own with aggressive hydration. Larger stones (greater than 5 mm) may need to be pulverized with lithotripsy or removal.",,

What is the most appropriate intervention at this time? ,Observation,Radical prostatectomy,Hormone therapy,Radiation,,q135.jpg,1,"In transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), a thin cylindrical instrument (resectoscope) is inserted through the urethra where it's surrounded by prostate tissue. An electrical loop cuts away excess prostate tissue to improve urine flow. See picture:In a man with advanced age if the tissue shows low grade (Stage T1a - Incidental histologic finding in 5% or less of the tumor resected) it is ok to observe without any further aggressive intervention. Options for more advance cases of prostate carcinoma include prostatectomy and radiation.",,
204,1,Medicine,"A 56 year old man, whose father died of prostate cancer, is found to have on digital rectal exam (DRE) a small nodule on the right lobe of his prostate. His PSA level is 2.2. The appropriate management is: ",Follow up in 3 months with DRE and PSA,Follow up in 6 months with DRE and PSA,Follow up in 12 months with DRE and PSA,Ultrasound guided biopsy now,,,4,"An annual digital rectal examination (DRE) beginning at age 50 year for the early detection of both rectal and prostate cancer is, recommended. PSA testing screening guidelines are still not established - insufficient evidence (in quality or quantity) to make a recommendation; however, other factors may influence decision making (done if required by patient). A PSA level of less than 4 ng/ml is normal. A level between 4 and 10 is the &lsquo;grey' zone and above 10 is suspicious for malignancy.During a DRE, a nodule must be taken seriously since 50% of prostate nodules are cancerous. Especially in this patient who has positive family history. The presence or absence of cancer in a prostate nodule is ordinarily determined by the results of a transrectal needle aspiration biopsy.",,
205,6,Surgery,An 86 year old woman develops ankle edema at the right medial malleolus. The area has a superficial ulcer and surrounding scarring. See picture:The most likely specific reason for this presentation is,Arterial insufficiency,Perforator incompetence,Claudication,Dermatologic Manifestations of Renal Disease,,q137.jpg,2,"This is a case specifically of perforator incompetence involving the veins of the lower extremity. Under ordinary circumstances the bulk of venous blood moves strictly from the superficial to the deep system. Failure of the valves of communicating perforator veins can permit a significant volume of blood to flow from deep veins backward into the superficial system, producing local congestion and venous hypertension. More important, perforator incompetence allows the extremely high pressures generated within deep veins by the calf muscle pump to be communicated to the superficial veins, which are not strong enough to tolerate the pressure. This high pressure produces excessive venous dilatation and secondary failure of superficial vein valves. This is one of the major mechanisms for the development of superficial venous incompetence and varicose veins.Claudication would present as calf pain in particular during exercise. Caused usually by atherosclerosis of the arteries that supply the muscles of the lower extremity.",,
206,1,Medicine,An elderly woman develops a stasis ulcer on her lower extremity that causes pigmentary changes. See picture: The most appropriate intervention in the prevention and treatment of this condition is: ,Pneumatic stockings,Stripping saphenous vein,Topical antibiotics,Anticoagulants,,q138.jpg,1,"Venous ulcers form when blood flow through the legs is reduced, causing blood to pool in the leg veins. Then, pressure increases in the veins and capillaries (tiny blood vessels that connect arteries and veins). The increased pressure causes fluid to leak from the blood vessels into surrounding tissue, and swelling develops. If venous ulcers result from chronic venous insufficiency, the legs are swollen, and the skin is dark reddish brown and very firm (a condition called stasis dermatitis). The skin may itch, and the ulcers are usually very painful.The goals of prevention and treatment are to reduce leg swelling and reduce the pressure in veins. If swelling is reduced enough, a venous ulcer may never form or may heal on its own. Often, specially designed bandages and pneumatic (compression) stockings help reduce swelling. If cellulitis or signs of an infection of deeper tissues (such as pus) are present, antibiotics are taken by mouth or given intravenously. Drugs, such as nonprescription antibiotics, should not be applied directly to the skin of the leg. These drugs can cause allergic reactions that worsen the problem, particularly when the skin is cracked or there is an open sore.",,
207,1,Medicine,A 20 year old tall thin man presents to the ER with difficulty breathing and chest pain when he tries to breath. A STAT Chest X-ray shows the following:What is the most appropriate immediate intervention?  ,Antibiotics,Needle thoracentesis,Chest tube,CT of chest,,q139.jpg,2,"Pneumothorax is air in the pleural space causing partial or complete lung collapse. Pneumothorax can occur spontaneously or from underlying pulmonary disease, trauma, or medical procedures. Symptoms include dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and anxiety. Dyspnea may be sudden or gradual in onset depending on the rate of development and size of the pneumothorax. Physical findings classically consist of absent tactile fremitus, hyperresonance to percussion, and decreased breath sounds on the side with the pneumothorax.Diagnosis is made with chest x-ray. Radiolucent air and the absence of lung markings juxtaposed between a shrunken lobe or lung and the parietal pleura are diagnostic of pneumothorax. Tracheal deviation and mediastinal shift occur with large pneumothoraces.Tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency. It should be treated immediately by inserting a 14- or 16-gauge needle with catheter through the chest wall in the 2nd intercostal space at the mid-clavicular line. The sound of high-pressure air escaping confirms diagnosis. Emergency decompression must be followed immediately by chest tube thoracostomy, after which the catheter is removed.",,
208,3,PMCH,Which is the least likely cause of HIV infection nowadays? ,Homosexuality,Heterosexuality,Prostitution,Drug abuse,Blood transfusion,,5,"When HIV first started appearing in large numbers in North America in the early 1980's is was called the disease of the 4 H's (Heroin users, Homosexuals, Hepatitis patients and Haitians). Since then the mode of transmission of the virus has extensively studied and the following are the primary modes of transmission of HIV are:1) Blood-to-blood transmission - through transfusion of, or direct contact with, HIV-infected blood, exposure to HIV-contaminated needles, syringes, and other equipment. 2) Sexual contact - unprotected vaginal, oral, or anal intercourse direct contact with HIV-infected body fluids such as semen and cervical and vaginal secretions. 3) Mother to newborn - during pregnancy, labor and delivery.Since 1985 all blood products all blood products are routinely tested for HIV before being given during transfusions.",,
209,1,Medicine,A 48 year old female presents suffering from left lower quadrant pain with non-bloody stool. Tenderness is present over the area. She is afebrile and has a normal rectal examination. Diverticulum is seen in a barium enema study. What is the appropriate intervention? ,Give antibiotic prophylaxis for 2 weeks,Try high fiber diet,Colonoscopy,Surgery,,q141.jpg,2,"Although this patient is young, she has early diverticulosis. A diverticulum (plural - diverticula) is medical term for an outpouching of a hollow (or a fluid filled) structure in the body, like an intestine.The development of diverticula is caused by spasms of the muscular layer of the intestine. The resulting pressure that these spasms exert on the intestinal wall causes a part of the wall to bulge at a point of weakness.Diverticulosis can cause painful cramps, diarrhea or other bowel movement disturbances, and blood in the stool. The narrow opening of a diverticulum can bleed, sometimes heavily, into the intestine and out through the rectum. Stool that is trapped in a diverticulum may cause not only bleeding but also inflammation and infection, resulting in diverticulitis.The diagnosis is confirmed by barium enema x-ray study or by colonoscopy. However, if the person has severe abdominal pain, computed tomography (CT) is performed instead, so as not to rupture the inflamed intestine.The goal of treatment is usually to reduce intestinal spasms, which is best achieved by maintaining a high-fiber diet (which consists of vegetables, fruits, and whole grains) and drinking plenty of fluids. An increased bulk in the large intestine reduces spasms, which in turn decreases the pressure on the walls of the large intestine.Since this patient has no fever or signs of infection antibiotics, colonoscopy and surgery are not necessary at this time.",,
210,1,Medicine,"An elderly man presents with hearing loss. On exam, air conduction is greater than bone conduction (AC&gt;BC) in the both ears. Weber test lateralizes to right.

The patient is asked to report in which ear the sound is heard louder.A patient with a unilateral sensorineural hearing loss would hear the sound loudest in the unaffected ear. A patient with a unilateral conductive hearing loss would hear the tuning fork loudest in the affected ear.The Rinne test is performed by placing a vibrating tuning fork initially on the mastoid process (behind the ear) until sound is no longer heard, the fork is then immediately placed just outside the ear. Normally, the sound is audible at the ear.In a normal ear, air conduction (AC) is better than bone conduction (BC). AC &gt; BC, and this is called a positive Rinne. In conductive hearing loss, bone conduction is better than air: BC &gt; AC, a negative Rinne. In sensorineural hearing loss, bone conduction and air conduction are both equally depreciated, maintaining the relative difference of: AC &gt; BC, a positive Rinne.

216,2,OBGYN,A woman whose mother had osteoporosis wants prophylaxis for this condition. What is the most appropriate treatment?  ,Vitamin D and calcium,Swimming,Analgesics,Vitamins,Avoiding physical activities,,1,"Osteoporosis is a condition in which a progressive decrease in the density of bones weakens the bones, making fractures likely. Risk factors for osteoporosis in women are: family members with osteoporosis, insufficient calcium in the diet, sedentary lifestyle, white or asian race and thin build.The most useful diagnostic test is the dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), which measures bone density at the sites at which major fractures are likely to occur - the spine and hip. Prevention involves maintaining or increasing bone density by consuming adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D and engaging in weight-bearing exercises.Exercise of the right type, called weight-bearing or load-bearing exercise, helps keep bones strong by causing the muscles and tendons to pull on the bones, which in turn stimulates bone cells to produce more bone.All exercise benefits your general fitness. Weight-bearing exercise is best for strengthening bones. Here are some examples: running and jogging, gymnastics, weight lifting -- dumbbells, barbells, machines, body weight exercises; walking (but less effective than running or jogging)The least effective exercises for bones are:-Swimming or water aerobics-Cycling-Parachuting and base jumping-Other minimal weight-bearing exercise activities ",,

Metformin is as effective as sulphonylureas at reducing HbA1c, and most importantly has a beneficial effect on overall mortality in obese patients.Metformin monotherapy is unlikely to be effective in patients who fail to respond to sulphonylureas, but in patients who are secondary failures to sulphonylureas, the addition of metformin causes substantial blood glucose lowering. Metformin should be avoided in patients with renal dysfunction. Otherwise its effects on bodyweight, serum lipids and its lack of hypoglycemia effect make it an excellent first line agent.",,

Since the age of onset of Huntington is usually after 35, we do not know if the father had the disease or not. The man is noted by the question mark. The pedigree is labeled with the corresponding alleles.Huntington's disease is autosomal dominant, needing only one affected allele from either parent to inherit the disease. Although this generally means there is a one in two chance of inheriting the disorder from an affected parentThe mans father will get one copy of the recessive allele &lsquo;a' from his father. His second allele will be the dominant &lsquo;A' with a 50% probability and a recessive &lsquo;a' with a 50% probability.The man will get one recessive &lsquo;a' allele from his mother. The other allele depends on what is fathers genotype is.

Physical features may include a larger anterior fontanel, persistence of a posterior fontanel, an umbilical hernia, and a large tongue (macroglossia).In the developed world, nearly all cases of congenital hypothyroidism are detected by the newborn screening program. These are based on measurement of TSH or thyroxine (T4) on the second or third day of life. If the TSH is high, or the T4 low, the infant's doctor and parents are called and a referral to a pediatric endocrinologist is recommended to confirm the diagnosis and initiate treatment. The goal of newborn screening programs is to detect and start treatment within the first 1-2 weeks of life. Treatment consists of a daily dose of thyroxine, available as a small tablet. Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), Edwards syndrome (Trisomy 18) and Patau syndrome (Trisomy 13) would not present like this.",,
223,1,Medicine,The appropriate initial management of deep venous thrombosis is to: ,Give heparin,Give warfarin,IVC filter,Pneumatic/compression stockings,,,1,"Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is clotting of blood in a deep vein of an extremity (usually calf or thigh) or the pelvis. DVT is the primary cause of pulmonary embolism (PE). DVT results from conditions that impair venous return, lead to endothelial injury or dysfunction, or cause hypercoagulability. DVT may be asymptomatic or cause pain and swelling in an extremity. Diagnosis is by history, physical examination, and duplex ultrasonography, with d-dimer or other testing as necessary. All patients with DVT are given anticoagulants, initially an injectable heparin (unfractionated or low mol weight), followed by warfarin.An Inferior vena cava filter (IVCF) may help prevent PE in patients with lower extremity DVT and contraindications to anticoagulants or with recurrent DVT (or emboli) despite adequate anticoagulation. Patients at higher risk of DVT should have compression devices or stockings placed for prevention.",,

These &lsquo;ectopic' pieces of endometrial tissue can travel and implant in areas such as the ovaries and uterosacral ligament, grow and cause severe pain.Symptoms depend on location of the implants and may include dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, infertility, dysuria, and pain during defecation. Diagnosis is suspected based on typical symptoms but must be confirmed by biopsy, usually via pelvic laparoscopy. These ectopic tissue must be visualized.Treatments include anti-inflammatory drugs, drugs to suppress ovarian function and endometrial tissue growth, surgical ablation and excision of endometriotic implants, and, if disease is severe and no childbearing is planned, hysterectomy plus oophorectomy.",,
225,2,OBGYN,"A woman with urinary incontinence, loses urine when she hears the hissing sound of tap water and during straining while laughing or sneezing. What type of incontinence does she have? ",Stress incontinence,Detrusor instability,Urge incontinence,Overflow incontinence,,,1,"There are three main types of incontinence in women, although they can occur in men also.Stress incontinence is loss of urine when you exert pressure or stress on your bladder by coughing, sneezing, laughing, exercising or lifting something heavy. It has nothing to do with psychological stress. Stress incontinence occurs when the sphincter muscle at the bladder is weakened. The problem is especially noticeable when you let your bladder get too full. Stress incontinence is one of the most common types of incontinence, often affecting women. Physical changes resulting from pregnancy, childbirth and menopause can cause stress incontinence. In men, removal of the prostate gland can lead to this type of incontinence. Urge incontinence is a sudden, intense urge to urinate, followed by an involuntary loss of urine. Your bladder muscle contracts and may give you a warning of only a few seconds to a minute to reach a toilet. With urge incontinence, you may also need to urinate often. The need to urinate may even wake you up several times a night. Simply going from sitting to standing may even cause you to leak urine. In urge incontinence, the bladder is said to be &quot;overactive&quot; it's contracting even when your bladder isn't full. Overflow incontinence is when one has frequent or constant dribble urine. This is an inability to empty your bladder, leading to overflow. With overflow incontinence, sometimes you may feel as if you never completely empty your bladder. When you try to urinate, you may produce only a weak stream of urine. This type of incontinence is common in people with a damaged bladder or blocked urethra and in men with prostate gland problems.",,
226,2,OBGYN,A G3P2 woman at 8 weeks gestation is found to have an ovarian cyst 6cm in size. What is the appropriate management at this time? ,Laparotomy,Observation,Medications to shrink cyst,Aspiration,,,2,"Cysts (fluid-filled structures) can resolve on their own. Cysts are not that uncommon during pregnancy, affecting about 1 in 1,000 pregnant women. The vast majority of ovarian masses found during pregnancy are benign. Ultrasound can be helpful in determining if a mass is benign or malignant, but it cannot do so with 100 percent certainty. If ultrasound shows that the mass is strictly fluid-filled, without septation or thick walls, it is probably benign.The problem with large, even benign, cysts during pregnancy is that they may rupture or torse (twist on themselves). Either of these events leads to significant pain for mom and the potential for miscarriage or preterm labor and delivery for the baby. Large (more than 6-8cm) cysts are usually removed surgically if they do not decrease in size spontaneously over the course of a few weeks. In pregnancy, the best time to operate is in the second trimester, ideally around 14-16 weeks. Occasionally, a cyst may be dealt with via laparoscopy, but very large cysts often require a large, open incision.",,

A colonoscopy has demonstrated skipped lesions throughout intestines.  What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms? ", Celiac disease, Herpes simplex 1, Crohn's disease, Ulcerative colitis, Irritable bowel syndrome,,3," Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect the entire GI tract.  It is more common amongst Caucasians, Jews and Asians and peaks in people's 20's.  It often presents with weight loss, recurrent abdominal cramping and diarrhea.  Ulcers can be visualized plainly in the oral cavity or lower along the GI tract with endoscopy (inflammatory patterns within the bowel are not continuous, termed &ldquo;skip lesions&rdquo;).  Endoscopy with biopsy is diagnostic.   Anal fissures and abscesses are common, and fistulae can develop between the GI tract, the skin, vagina or bladder.It is treated comprehensively with modifications to diet and drugs (sulfasalazine, prednisone for acute flare ups, immunosuppressives, antibiotics, antidiarrheals and/or new biologicals such as infliximab).  In certain cases, surgery is warranted (fistulae, perforations or obstructions).Ulcerative colitis, b), always involves inflammation to the rectum, a point of which will be alluded to in some aspect in a questions' stem; furthermore, it does not involve lesions in the oral cavity.

Symptoms are weakness and paralysis. Diagnosis is clinical and with laboratory identification of toxin. Treatment is with support and antitoxin. Home-canned foods are the most common sources, but commercially prepared foods have been implicated in about 10% of outbreaks. Vegetables, fish, fruits, and condiments are the most common vehicles, but beef, milk products, pork, poultry, and other foods have been involved. C. botulinum spores are highly heat-resistant and may survive boiling for several hours at 100 C. However, exposure to moist heat at 120 C for 30 min kills the spores.

It occurs principally when there is obstruction to the cervical os, and can be a complication of fibroids, uterine or cervical malignancy, and scarring after radiotherapy. It can also occur secondary to intra-uterine infection. Recently there has been an increase in genital tuberculosis, and this occasionally presents with pyometra.With each heat cycle, the uterine lining engorges in preparation for pregnancy.

240,1,Medicine,"In a patient with vertigo, what sign or symptom would not lead to a diagnosis of viral labyrinthitis? ",Otorrhea,Nystagmus,Hearing loss,Tinnitus,,,1,"Labyrinthitis is a balance disorder. It is an inflammatory process affecting the labyrinths that house the vestibular system (which sense changes in head position) of the inner ear.In addition to balance control problems, a labyrinthitis patient may encounter hearing loss and tinnitus. Labyrinthitis is caused by a virus, but it can also arise from bacterial infection, head injury, an allergy or as a reaction to a particular medicine. Both bacterial and viral labyrinthitis can cause permanent hearing loss, although this is rare. Labyrinthitis often follows an upper respiratory tract infection (URI).When working properly, the vestibular system also relays information on head movement to the eye muscle, forming the vestibulo-ocular reflex, in order to retain continuous visual focus during motion. When the vestibular system is affected by labyrinthitis, rapid, undesired eye motion (nystagmus), often results from the improper indictations of rotational motion.",,
241,1,Medicine,What is the most sensitive method for diagnosing aortic dissection?  ,MRI,CT scan,TEE,CXR,,q172.gif,1,"Aortic dissection is the surging of blood through a tear in the aortic intima with separation of the intima and media and creation of a false lumen. The intimal tear may be a primary event or secondary to hemorrhage within the media. The dissection may occur anywhere along the aorta and extend proximally or distally into other arteries.Hypertension is an important contributor. Symptoms and signs include abrupt onset of tearing chest or back pain, and dissection may result in aortic regurgitation and compromised circulation in branch arteries. Diagnosis is by imaging tests (eg, transesophageal echocardiography, CT angiography, MRI, contrast aortography). MRI has over 90% sensitivity and greater than 95% specificity. It is the most sensitive method for diagnosing aortic dissection and has similar specificity to CT scanning. MRI shows the site of intimal tear, type and extent of dissection, and presence of aortic insufficiency, as well as the surrounding mediastinal structures.Treatment always involves aggressive BP control and serial imaging to monitor progression of dissection, surgical repair of the aorta and placement of a synthetic graft is needed for ascending aortic dissection and for certain descending aortic dissections.",,

It is an acute, usually rapidly progressive inflammatory polyneuropathy characterized by muscular weakness and mild distal sensory loss. In most patients, the syndrome begins 1-3 weeks after an infectious disorder, surgery, or vaccination. Infection is the trigger in  50% of patients, common pathogens include Campylobacter jejuni, enteric viruses, herpesviruses, and Mycoplasma. Flaccid weakness predominates in most patients, it is always more prominent than sensory abnormalities and may be most prominent proximally. Relatively symmetric weakness with paresthesias usually begins in the legs and progresses to the arms, but it occasionally begins in the arms or head. Diagnosis is clinical. If Guillain-Barr syndrome is suspected, patients should be admitted to a hospital for electromyography (EMG), CSF analysis, and measurement of forced vital capacity. Guillain-Barr syndrome is a medical emergency, requiring constant monitoring and support of vital functions, typically in an ICU. Plasmapheresis helps when done early in the syndrome and is the treatment of choice in acutely ill patients. Immune globulin is also effective when given early.",,
247,2,OBGYN,What is the most common management of carpal tunnel syndrome in pregnancy? ,Diuretics,Splint,Avoid activities that precipitate it,Fasciotomy,,q178.jpg,2,"The carpal tunnel is a bony canal formed by the wrist bones on three sides and a ligament that runs across the wrist on the other. The swelling and fluid retention that's so common during pregnancy can increase the pressure in this relatively narrow and inflexible space, compressing the median nerve that runs through it.The median nerve gives sensation to the thumb and the index, middle, and half of the ring finger and is responsible for movement of a muscle at the base of the thumb. Pressure on this nerve is what causes the symptoms. To relieve the pain it is important to avoid any activity that requires forceful, repetitive hand movements. Although these movements may not have caused the carpal tunnel syndrome, they can make symptoms worse.Accumulation of fluid is the likely etiology of carpal tunnel syndrome in pregnant women. Symptoms may first be noted during any of the three trimesters, but the diagnosis is most often made during the final trimester and resolves with delivery.Since its not due to repetitive movements and is more associated with the increase of fluid, simply &quot;avoiding repetitive or agrivating movements&quot; won't actually help much, and a better treatment would be night splinting.",,

The prevention involves infants be placed supine (on back) for sleep. The incidence of SIDS increases with overheating (clothing, blankets, hot room) and in cold weather. Thus, every effort should be made to avoid an overheated or an overly cold environment, to avoid overwrapping the infant, and to remove soft bedding, such as sheepskin, pillows, stuffed toys/animals, and comforters, from the crib. Mothers should avoid smoking during pregnancy, and infants should not be exposed to smoke. Note: &ldquo;Prone&rdquo; (face down) is often confused with &ldquo;supine&rdquo; (face up).",,

Patients may initially report fatigue in the lumbar region after prolonged sitting or standing. The curve is most pronounced when patients bend forward. Most curves are convex to the right in the thoracic area and to the left in the lumbar area, so that the right shoulder is higher than the left. X-ray examination should include standing anteroposterior and lateral views of the spine.Prompt referral to an orthopedist is indicated. Moderate curves (20 to 40) are treated conservatively (eg, with a cast or brace) to prevent further deformity. Severe curves ( 40) can often be ameliorated surgically (eg, spinal fusion with rod placement).",,

For example, rageful person who is accustomed to lashing out might rechannel their passion through a positive hobby.Regression: is a defense mechanism leading to a return to earlier, especially to infantile, patterns of thoughts or behavior, or stage of functioning. For example, an adult woman who is told that her father just died, will react by throwing a temper tantrum and crying like a child.Splitting: when a person thinks purely in extremes. Everything is either all good or all bad.Projection: is a defense mechanism in which one attributes to others one's own unacceptable or unwanted thoughts or/and emotions.

",Chance of fertility is 10%,Chance of fertility is 50%,He is impotent,He could have a child with in-vitro fertilization (IVF),,,4,"Abnormal morphology (shape) and motility can prevent the sperm from reaching the egg. The sperm need motility to be able to swim well and survive for a number of hours in the female reproductive tract. If they do meet, abnormal-looking sperm might be incapable of fertilization.The motility of this man's sperm is poor and therefore he is unlikely to be able to be fertile. In addition, infertility specialists have stated that 1 million motile sperm is the minimum amount of sperm associated with a reasonable chance of pregnancy success at intrauterine insemination. However in-vitro fertilization (IVF) can be used to treat infertility due to his oligospermia.

Much like the appearance of varicose veins in legs, the varicocele can be best seen or felt when standing. In the standing position, men with varicoceles may note fullness around and/or above the testicles. This fullness should disappear when lying down. This is called reflux when blood travels the wrong way (backwards) through a vein. The vein responsible in the case of a varicocele is called the testicular vein. Diagnosis is made by physical examination. The physical exam is performed in a warm room to avoid the cold shower effect on the scrotum. The examination must be performed lying down and standing up. A varicocele which does not decompress when lying down is concerning. It could mean that there is a mass blocking the vein in the abdomen. This is rare but very important to recognize. A varicocele can be seen on an ultrasound too. Varicocele treatment procedures involve blocking the flow of blood in the veins so that they cannot reflux. This can be done from outside the veins (surgery) or from inside the veins (embolization). The testicle then drains itself through other channels which generally do not reflux.",,

Symptoms include pain often localized to the epigastrium and relieved by food or antacids. The pain is described as burning or gnawing, or sometimes as a sensation of hunger. The course is usually chronic and recurrent. Diagnosis of peptic ulcer is suggested by patient history and confirmed by endoscopy (EGD). Treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers requires eradication of H. pylori when present.Methods of decreasing acidity include a number of drugs including proton pump inhibitos and H2 blockers.Nissen fundoplication is a surgical treatment for chronic GERD.",,
285,1,Medicine,A patient who has a chronic peptic ulcer asks for the best method for curing this disease. Your answer is: ,Helicobacter pylori eradication,Proton pump inhibitors,H2 blockers,Nissen fundoplication,,,1,"H. pylori and NSAIDs disrupt normal mucosal defense and repair, making the mucosa more susceptible to acid. H. pylori infection is present in 50 to 70% of patients with duodenal ulcers and 30 to 50% of patients with gastric ulcers. If H. pylori is eradicated, only 10% of patients have recurrence of peptic ulcer disease, compared with 70% recurrence in patients treated with acid suppression alone. Symptoms include pain often localized to the epigastrium and relieved by food or antacids. The pain is described as burning or gnawing, or sometimes as a sensation of hunger. The course is usually chronic and recurrent. Diagnosis of peptic ulcer is suggested by patient history and confirmed by endoscopy (EGD).

287,2,OBGYN,"A pregnant woman at 20 weeks presents with vaginal bleeding. She is type O, Rh negative. She doesn't know the fathers blood type. When will you give Rhogam? ",28 weeks gestation,2 weeks postpartum,Now,At delivery,,,3,"Rh incompatibility, also known as Rh disease, is a condition that occurs when a woman with Rh-negative blood type is exposed to Rh-positive blood cells, leading to the development of Rh antibodies.Prevention is Rh0(D) immune globulin injection for women at risk. Because fetomaternal transfer and likelihood of sensitization is greatest at termination of pregnancy, the preparation is given within 72 h after termination of each pregnancy, whether by delivery, abortion, or treatment of ectopic pregnancy. Treatment at termination of pregnancy is occasionally ineffective because sensitization occurred earlier during pregnancy. Therefore, at about 28 wk, all pregnant women with Rh-negative blood and no known prior sensitization are given a dose. Some experts recommend a 2nd dose if delivery has not occurred by 40 wk. Rh0(D) immune globulin should also be given after any episode of vaginal bleeding and after amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Anti-Rh antibodies persist for &gt; 3 mo after one dose. ",,
288,2,OBGYN,What is the diagnostic test used to confirm a diagnosis of Down's syndrome in the fetus of a pregnant woman at 12 weeks gestation? ,Chorionic sampling villous,Amniocentesis,Ultrasound,Triple screen,,,1,"The triple screen test is a maternal blood screening test that looks for three specific substances: AFP, hCG, and Estriol. The triple screen test is performed between the 15th and 20th week of pregnancy although results obtained in the 16th -18th week are said to be the most accurate. Low values for AFP and Estriol and high values for hCG are seen in Down's Syndrome. Low levels of all three seen in trisomy 18. High levels for AFP are seen in neural tube defects like spina bifida Ultrasound Screening is used to confirm the gestational age of the fetus (it's more accurate than dating from the mother's last menstrual cycle). Another benefit of the ultrasound can also pick up problems of a serious medical nature, such as blockage of the small intestine or heart defects. Knowing these defects exist as early as possible will benefit the treatment of the child after birth.Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS) is a procedure where a small amount of tissue is taken from the young placenta (also called the chorionic layer). These cells contain the fetal chromosomes that can be tested for Down syndrome. CVS is usually carried out between the 10th and 12th weeks of pregnancy.Amniocentesis is a procedure used to collect amniotic fluid, the liquid that is in the womb. A needle is inserted through the mother's abdominal wall into the uterus, using ultrasound to guide the needle. This fluid contains fetal cells that can be examined for chromosome tests. Amniocentesis is usually carried out between the 14th and 18th week of pregnancy; some doctors may do them as early as the 13th week.",,
289,5,Psychiatry,"A woman who is found unconscious at home is rushed to the ER. A STAT ABG (arterial blood gas) done shows acidosis and low pO2, high pCO2. What is the most likely diagnosis? ",Theophilline poisoning,Tricyclic antidepressant poisoning,Mild aspirin poisoning,Hyperventilation,,,2,"With tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose, symptoms typically occur within 2 hours of ingestion, which corresponds to the peak tricyclic antidepressant serum level, which may range from 2-12 hours. Symptoms include: palpitations, chest pain, hypotension, decreased mental status and respiratory depression. ABG will show of acidosis and hypoxia.Theophylline overdose leads to respiratory alkalosisHyperventilation would show an alkalosis on ABG.ASA toxicity - Initially, a respiratory alkalosis develops secondary to direct stimulation of the respiratory centers. This may be the only consequence of mild salicylism. The kidneys excrete potassium, sodium, and bicarbonate, resulting in alkaline urine. (A severe metabolic (ketolactic) acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis may develop with severe salicylate intoxication) ",,
290,2,OBGYN,"A 24 year old woman with 6 weeks amenorrhea develops continuous lower abdominal pain and minimal vaginal bleeding. The uterus is slightly enlarged, the cervix is soft and tender on motion. There is adnexal tenderness. The history and clinical findings are most suggestive of: ",Salpingitis,Ruptured ovarian cyst,Ectopic pregnancy,Threatened abortion,Twisted ovarian cyst,q219.jpg,3,"In ectopic pregnancy, implantation occurs in a site other than the endometrial lining of the uterine cavity, for example in the fallopian tube, uterine interstitium, cervix, ovary, or abdominal or pelvic cavity. Ectopic pregnancies cannot be carried to term and eventually rupture or involute. Early symptoms and signs include pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, and cervical motion tenderness. Syncope or hemorrhagic shock can occur with rupture. Diagnosis is by -human chorionic gonadotropin measurement and ultrasonography. Treatment is with laparoscopic or open surgical resection or with IM methotrexate.",,
291,5,Psychiatry,A 17 year old girl presents to the ER. On exam she has pinpoint pupils and abnormal behavior. What is the most appropriate test to order at this time? ,Urine drug test,CT head scan,BHCG,Psych consult,,,1,"This teenage girl is likely abusing drugs, in particular heroin.Opioids have many effects. They are strong sedating drugs and cause people to become quiet and introspective. Opioids may also produce euphoria, sometimes simply because severe pain has finally been relieved. The dull pain may enhance sexual pleasure. They also cause constipation, flushed or warm skin and lowered blood pressure, itching, constricted pupils, slow, shallow breathing, a slow heart rate, and low body temperature. Opioids may cause confusion, especially in older people.Many complications can arise from opioid addiction, especially if the drugs are injected with shared unsterilized needles. For example, viral hepatitis, which causes liver damage, can be spread through shared needles. Infections can occur at the site of injection or be carried through the bloodstream (sepsis), causing infections in the brain and bones.",,

Common physical findings include bradycardia, low BP, hypothermia, lanugo hair or slight hirsutism, and edema. Even patients who appear cachectic tend to remain very active (including pursuing vigorous exercise programs), are free of symptoms of nutritional deficiencies, and have no unusual susceptibility to infections.Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment is with cognitive-behavioral therapy; olanzapine may help with weight gain, and SSRIs, especially fluoxetine, may help prevent relapse.",,
293,5,Psychiatry,"In a bulimic patient, what medication is likely to help the most? ",Lithium,Haloperidol,Clomipramine,Fluoxetine,,,4,"Bulimia nervosa is recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by self-induced vomiting, laxative or diuretic abuse, vigorous exercise, or fasting.Most symptoms and physical complications result from purging. Self-induced vomiting leads to erosion of dental enamel of the front teeth and to painless salivary gland enlargement. Serious fluid and electrolyte disturbances, especially hypokalemia, occur occasionally. The diagnosis is suspected when patients express marked concern about weight gain and have wide fluctuations in weight, especially with excessive laxative use or unexplained hypokalemia. Swollen parotid glands, scars on the knuckles (from induced vomiting), and dental erosion are danger signs.Treatment is with psychotherapy and SSRIs, especially fluoxetine.",,

The parents don't think that she's taking any drugs. Which of the following is the most likely problem? ",Cocaine withdrawal,Normal teenager,Cannabis abuse,Schizophrenia,,,4,"Schizophrenia is characterized by psychosis (loss of contact with reality), hallucinations (false perceptions), delusions (false beliefs), disorganized speech and behavior, flattened affect (restricted range of emotions), cognitive deficits (impaired reasoning and problem solving), and occupational and social dysfunction. The cause is unknown, but evidence for a genetic component is strong. Symptoms usually begin in adolescence or early adulthood. One or more episodes of symptoms must last &ge; 6 months before the diagnosis is made. Treatment consists of drug therapy, psychotherapy, and rehabilitation. Worldwide, the prevalence of schizophrenia is about 1%. The average age at onset is 18 years in men and 25 years in women. Onset is rare in childhood, but early adolescent or late-life onset (when it is sometimes called paraphrenia) may occur.This is a typical presentation of schizophrenia, where a promising teenager goes off to college or university then declines drastically with no apparent cause.",,

297,1,Medicine,Which medication works well to discourage people with alcohol abuse from drinking? ,Abilify,Fluoxetine,Disulfiram,Clozapine,,,3,"In the treatment of alcohol abuse, a rehabilitation program is often the best approach. Rehabilitation programs combine medical supervision and psychotherapy, including one-on-one and group therapy. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) has benefited alcoholics more than any other approach. The patient must find an AA group in which he is comfortable. AA provides the patient with nondrinking friends who are always available and a nondrinking environment in which to socialize. Drug therapy should be used in combination with psychotherapy. Disulfiram interferes with the metabolism of acetaldehyde (an intermediary product in the oxidation of alcohol) so that acetaldehyde accumulates. Drinking alcohol within 12 hours of taking disulfiram produces facial flushing in 5 to 15 minutes, then intense vasodilation of the face and neck with suffusion of the conjunctivae, throbbing headache, tachycardia, hyperpnea, and sweating. With high doses of alcohol, nausea and vomiting may follow in 30 to 60 minutes and may lead to hypotension, dizziness, and sometimes fainting and collapse. The reaction can last up to 3 hours. Few patients risk ingesting alcohol while taking disulfiram because of the intense discomfort.",,
298,1,Medicine,The correct initial dosage and frequency for levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson disease is: ,One 100mg tablet once a day,One 100mg tablet twice a day,One 100mg tablet three times a day,One 100mg tablet four times a day,,,3,"Sinemet (carbidopa/levadopa) dosage is best initiated with one 25mg/100mg tablet three times a day. This dosage schedule provides 75 mg of carbidopa and 300 mg of levadopa per day. Levodopa is the metabolic precursor of dopamine, crosses the blood-brain barrier into the basal ganglia, where it is decarboxylated to form dopamine. Coadministration of the peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor carbidopa prevents levodopa catabolism, thus lowering the levodopa dosage requirements and minimizing adverse effects. Levodopa is most effective at relieving bradykinesia and rigidity, although tremor is often substantially reduced. Mildly affected patients who take levodopa may return to nearly normal, and bedbound patients may become ambulatory.",,

",Call the child's teacher,Counsel the mother again,Child protection service,Call the police,,,3,"Child protection service (CPS) or children's aid society (CAS) is a service physicians or the general public can contact and report suspected cases of child neglect or abuse.CPS agencies generally perform a series of functions as follows:They receive reports of child maltreatment allegations. Then they determine if a received report's allegations meet statutory definitions for child maltreatment. If a received report is accepted, then CPS &quot;investigates&quot; or &quot;assesses&quot; the allegations through contacts with the family and pertinent collateral-information providers. If the child-maltreatment allegations prove sufficiently credible and/or if the family is in need of services to prevent future maltreatment, they are generally provided. If the child's remaining in the home creates an imminent or significant long-term risk to the child's safety, then arrangement for the child's placement outside of the home is made either with the family's consent or through the courts.",,
301,3,PMCH,Which of the following is true regarding most cases of elderly abuse?,Depression in the elderly decreases the incidence,Medical condition in the elderly decreases the incidence,The abuser is not a relative,Victims are usually men,Perpetrator is usually the caregiver,,5,"Elder abuse is an extremely complex problem. Caring for a non-well older adult suffering from a mental or physical impairment is highly stressful. Individuals who do not have the requisite skills, information, resources, etc. and who are otherwise ill-prepared for the caregiving role may experience extreme stress and frustration. This may lead to elder abuse and/or neglect.It has been argued that as an older adult's dependency increases so does the resentment and stress of the caregiver. Studies have found that individuals in poor health are more likely to be abused than individuals who are in relatively good health. In addition, caregivers who are dependent on the elder financially are also more likely to perpetrate abuse. Women are believed to be the most common victims of abuse, perhaps because they report abuse at higher rates or because the severity of injury in women typically is greater than in men.",,
302,2,OBGYN,A 22 year old pregnant woman wants to know the chance of having a baby with Down syndrome or neural tube defects. She has a sister with a neural tube defect. Which of the following will you do as an initial screen for both? ,Chorionic villi sampling,Amniocentesis,Triple screen,Ultrasound,,,3,"The triple screen measures AFP, hCG and estriol. This test is the initial test to screen for Down syndrome and Neural tube defects (NTD). Testing will identify 60% of the babies with Down Syndrome and 80-90% of the babies with neural tube defects.The triple screen test is a maternal blood screening test that looks for three specific substances: AFP, hCG, and Estriol.

Which of the following is the most appropriate advice? ,Chloroquine prophylaxis cannot be given as this is teratogenic,Hepatitis A vaccine cannot be given,She needs diphtheria and tetanus booster if her last dose was given 10 years ago,She will need the MMR vaccine,,,3,"When traveling to Cambodia, malaria prophylaxis is recommended. Chloroquine is pregnancy category C and risk and benefits must be weighed before giving this drug to a pregnant woman.The safety of hepatitis A vaccination during pregnancy has not been determined; however, because hepatitis A vaccine is produced from inactivated hepatitis A virus, the theoretical risk to the developing fetus is expected to be low. The risk associated with vaccination should be weighed against the risk for hepatitis A in pregnant women who may be at high risk for exposure to hepatitis A virus. Pregnancy is not a contraindication for use of Tdap.Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and its component vaccines should not be administered to women known to be pregnant.",,
304,2,OBGYN,An obese woman who has poorly controlled diabetes on glyburide tells you that she wants to get pregnant. She has stopped taking her birth control pills. What will you advise her? ,Optimize gycemic control on glyburide ,Switch to insulin,Change glyburide to another oral anti-hyperglycemic,Maintain blood glucose on diet and exercise only,,,2,"Abundant data clearly show that uncontrolled maternal diabetes is teratogenic. It appears that in many cases, adverse fetal outcomes that have been attributed to oral glucose-lowering agents&mdash;including various anomalies, stillbirths, macrosomia, and neonatal hypoglycemia&mdash;were probably due to the diabetes itself.In the best scenario, the woman should have optimization of glucose control and HbA1C before pregnancy. Diet and exercise are standard therapy. Insulin should be prescribed if glucose levels continue to be elevated.If she has been taking oral agents, the dose should be adjusted to achieve optimal diabetes control while on adequate contraception, then switched to insulin once HbA1C is optimized and she's ready to become pregnant. (continuing glyburide or metformin is controversial)",,
305,1,Medicine,A 58 year old man presents to your office with a history of having an episode of sudden visual loss in his right eye. The patient describes the loss of vision as similar to someone pulling a cover over his right eye. Vision returned to the right eye after 10 minutes. This visual field defect is secondary to which one of the following?  ,Scotoma,Amaurosis fugax,Strabismus,Esotropia,Night blindness,,2,"Amaurosis Fugax occurs when emboli (blood clots) travel from the carotid artery (near the heart) to the retinal arteries, thereby blocking the blood supply to the part of the eye known as the retina, and resulting in vision loss. In young patients, spasm of the retinal arteries blocks the blood supply. A curtain appears to pass down over the visual field, causing complete loss of vision in the affected eye that lasts a few minutes. Diagnosis is made by examination by an ophthalmologist. Tests such as an ultrasound of carotid arteries may also be done.Immediate evaluation by an ophthalmologist is needed. Treatment of underlying causes which, if due to carotid artery disease, may include anti-platelet medications (e.g., aspirin, Plavix) or carotid endarterectomy (surgically removing cholesterol plaque in the carotid artery).",,

",To observe the patient,To administer vasodilators,To administer analgesics,Cut open the plaster near the fingers,Cut open the entire plaster cast immediately,,5,"Volkmann's ischemia occurs when there is a lack of blood flow to the forearm, usually caused by increased pressure that results from swelling (compartment syndrome).The hallmark symptom is pain that does not improve with rest or non-sedating pain medications, and will continue to get worse with time. If the pressure is allowed to persist, there will be decreased sensation, weakness, and paleness of the skin.The best treatment is early surgery to release the pressure in the forearm before any permanent injury to the muscles and nerves occurs.",,
307,1,Medicine,A 40 year old woman presents with a self-detected hard breast mass. Which one of the following is the procedure of choice for confirming the diagnosis?  ,Mammography,Thermography,Ultrasonography,Aspiration cytology,Excisional biopsy,,5,"In the evaluation of a breast mass the following points are important to consider:Painful, tender, rubbery lumps in a younger woman with previous history of similar findings suggest fibrocystic changes. A stony hard, irregular lump with skin dimpling suggests cancer. Initially, physicians try to differentiate solid from cystic lumps because cysts are rarely cancerous. Typically, ultrasonography is done. Lesions that appear cystic are sometimes aspirated, and solid lumps are evaluated with mammography followed by imaging-guided biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Excisional biopsy is the gold standard for evaluating breast masses.",,

Physical examination reveals clubbing with coarse crackles in both lung bases and enlarged lymph nodes are palpated. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ,Asthma,Reflux-induced cough,Chronic bronchitis,Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,Sarcoidosis,,4,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), also known as cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, is a chronic, progressive interstitial lung disease with an unknown cause. It is one of the two classic interstitial lung diseases, the other being sarcoidosis.IPF is slightly more common in males and usually presents in patients greater than 50 years of age. Average survival from time of diagnosis varies between 2.5 and 3.5 years, depending on severity, although some patients live greater than 10 years.Symptoms are gradual in onset. The most common are dyspnea (difficulty breathing), but also include nonproductive cough, clubbing (a disfigurement of the fingers), and crackles (crackling sound in lungs during inhalation).Sarcoidosis is an immune system disorder characterized by non-caseating granulomas (small inflammatory nodules). It most commonly arises in young adults. The cause of the disease is still unknown. Virtually any organ can be affected; however, granulomas most often appear in the lungs or the lymph nodes.Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease that can affect any organ. Common symptoms are vague, such as fatigue unchanged by sleep, lack of energy, weight loss, aches and pains, arthralgia, dry eyes, blurry vision, shortness of breath, a dry hacking cough or skin lesions such as erythema nodosum.",,
309,1,Medicine,"Within minutes of eating some peanuts, a 23 year old woman develops generalized pruritus and hyperemia of the skin, followed shortly by swelling of the face and eyelids, dyspnea, and laryngeal edema. This reaction is mediated by which one of the following?  ",Antigen-antibody complexes,Cytotoxic T cells,IgA antibodies,IgE antibodies,IgG antibodies,,4,"An allergic reaction is when the immune system mistakes a harmless substance for dangerous one and produces an antibody called immunoglobulin E, more commonly known as IgE. When an allergic person is exposed to an allergen, IgE is produced to fight off the specific allergen. For example, if someone is allergic to peanuts and eats some, then an anti-peanut IgE antibody is produced. Each time IgE is produced, the IgE molecules attach themselves to mast cells that are found in large numbers in the eyes, nose, lungs, intestines, and immediately beneath the skin. These mast cells contain many chemicals, including a substance called histamine which, when released into the body, can cause runny nose, sneezing, watery eyes, itching, hives, and wheezing. These effects are recognized as allergy symptoms.In some cases, reactions can occur in several places throughout the body. Welts or hives may appear, spasm in the lungs may cause coughing or wheezing, the throat and tongue may swell; if anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) occurs, it may be fatal.",,
310,2,OBGYN,A 70 year old woman presents to your office with a lump in her breast. Which one of the following is the greatest risk factor for cancer?  ,Nulliparity,Positive family history,Use of hormone replacement therapy,Early menarche,Advanced age,,5,"Strong risk factors for breast cancer:Increasing age: the primary risk factor for breast cancer in most women is older age. Overall, 85 percent of cases occur in women 50 years of age and older, while only 5 percent of breast cancers develop in women younger than age 40. Family history: women who have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer are at a higher risk for breast cancer than those who lack such a history. Other risk factors:Early menarche: during a woman's reproductive years, estrogen stimulates cells of the breast's glandular tissue to divide. The longer a woman is exposed to estrogen, the greater her risk for breast cancer. Estrogen exposure is increased if a woman began menstruating at or before 11 years of age, or if she experiences menopause at age 55 years or older.Nulliparity: women who have never given birth are more likely to develop breast cancer after menopause than women who have given birth multiple times. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT): Studies have shown that long-term use of combined estrogen-progestin (approximately five years) in women ages 50 to 79 increases a woman's risk of breast cancer.",,

312,5,Psychiatry,A 24 year old man is brought to the emergency room after being found unresponsive in a city park. Physical examination reveals pinpoint pupils unresponsive to light and a respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute. Which one of the following is the most likely cause?  ,Tricyclic antidepressant overdose,Morphine overdose,Arsenic poisoning,Lead intoxication,Alcohol intoxication,,2,"Morphine is the principal constituent of opium.Morphine is highly addictive. Tolerance (the need for higher and higher doses to maintain the same effect) and physical and psychological dependence develop quickly. Morphine activates the brain's reward systems. A Morphine overdose happens when you consume more Morphine than your body can safely handle. Morphine users are constantly flirting with Morphine overdose, and the difference between the high they're seeking and serious injury or death is often quite small. Symptoms of a Morphine overdose include: cold clammy skin, flaccid muscles, lowered blood pressure, &quot;pinpoint&quot; or dilated pupils, sleepiness, stupor, coma, slowed breathing (respiratory depression), difficulty breathing and slow pulse rate.",,

Which one of the following statements concerning the suicide assessment of this patient is true?  ,Discussing suicide with persons suspected of feeling suicidal may increase their risk of suicide,Persons with a recent suicide attempt are at less risk for eventually killing themselves,Depressed persons who commit suicide can do so as they begin to improve,Persons with schizophrenia are at less risk for suicide,Persons with schizophrenia do not usually communicate their intentions,,3,In the assessment of suicide it is important to assess the following indicators:Previous attempts: 50% to 80% of those who commit suicide have previously attempted it. Depression: This symptom combined with problems sleeping and eating increases the risk approximately 500 times. People are more likely to be at risk when they are coming out of a depression rather than when they are profoundly depressed. The presence of psychotic thinking: Often severely disturbed people believe death to be a temporary rather than permanent state. They fully expect to return tomorrow after committing suicide today. Confusion and disorientation also adds significantly to the risk factors.,,

The test gives a good estimate of how well diabetes is being managed over time. In particular over the past 3 months, since that is the life span of the red blood cell that contains the hemoglobin molecule.This test measures blood sugar control over an extended period in people with diabetes. In general, the higher your HbA1C value, the higher the risk that you will develop complications from diabetes (eye disease, kidney disease, nerve damage, heart disease, and stroke). This is especially true if your HbA1C remains elevated on more than one occasion.Most physicians will consider a HbA1C less than 7 as an indicator of good diabetic control.Unlike a diary, the HbA1C value does not lie.",,

Otosclerosis also may produce a sensorineural hearing loss, particularly when the foci of otosclerotic bone are adjacent to the scala media. Half of all cases are inherited. The measles virus may play an inciting role in patients with a genetic predisposition for otosclerosis.Although about 10% of white adults have some otosclerosis (compared with 1% of blacks), only about 10% of affected people develop conductive hearing loss. Hearing loss from otosclerosis may manifest as early as age 7 or 8, but most cases do not become evident until the late teen or early adult years, when slowly progressive, asymmetric hearing loss is diagnosed. Fixation of the stapes may progress rapidly during pregnancy.A hearing aid may restore hearing. Alternatively, microsurgery to remove some or all of the stapes and to replace it with a prosthesis may be beneficial.",,

It occurs when you take certain combinations of prescription medications that affect serotonin levels. Signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome range from restlessness and rapid heartbeat to muscle rigidity and seizures. These go away quickly with treatment, which may include discontinuing use of the medications causing the symptoms along with taking other drugs such as muscle relaxants and serotonin-production blocking agents. If not treated quickly, serotonin syndrome can become life-threatening.Serotonin syndrome generally occurs when you take multiple drugs that affect serotonin levels in your body. In particular, taking a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) along with triptans, a class of migraine medications, may cause the condition, potentially raising serotonin to dangerous levels.However, serotonin syndrome can also occur when you start a single new drug that affects serotonin levels or when you take an increased dose of such a drug that you've previously used. Therefore it is recommended that when changing from an MAOI to an SSRI, a two week gap should be allowed before starting the SSRI.",,

What is your next step? ,Urine gram stain and culture,Hydroxyurea,Transfusion,Parenteral opiate,Oxygen supplementation,,4,"Failure to treat acute pain aggressively and promptly may lead to chronic pain syndrome.Treatment of pain crises is primarily pharmacologic in nature, and opioids represent the mainstay of therapy.  Patients with severe pain should be given a parenteral opiate in full therapeutic doses at fixed intervals (and not as needed) until pain diminishes at which time the opiate is tapered and then stopped and oral analgesic therapy is instituted. Hydration is another mainstay of treatment.For all types of pain, incentive spirometry is recommended. For frequent and severe pain, long-term hydroxyurea (HU) is presently the accepted treatment. For HU nonresponders, chronic transfusions for a limited period may be an option. Management of constant pain is extremely difficult, and expert advice should be obtained.Perform urinalysis if the patient has fever or signs of urinary tract infection (UTI). Patients with sickle cell anemia often have hematuria and isosthenuria. If signs of urinary tract infection are present, obtain a urine Gram stain and culture.Transfusions are not needed for the usual anemia or episodes of pain associated with sickle cell disease. Urgent replacement of blood is often required for sudden severe anemia due to ASS, parvovirus B19 infection, or in hyperhemolytic crises.Oxygen supplementation is only beneficial if the patient has hypoxia.

Vaginal prolapse is descent of the vagina or vaginal cuff after hysterectomy. Symptoms include vaginal pressure and fullness. Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment includes reduction, pessaries, and surgery. A prolapsed uterus is graded based on level of descent: to the upper vagina (1st degree), to the introitus (2nd degree), or external to the introitus (3rd degree or total, sometimes referred to as procidentia). Vaginal prolapse may be 2nd or 3rd degree.Pregnancy and trauma incurred during childbirth, particularly with large babies or after a difficult labor and delivery, are the main causes of muscle weakness leading to uterine prolapse. Loss of muscle tone associated with aging and reduced amounts of circulating estrogen after menopause also may contribute to uterine prolapse. In rare circumstances, uterine prolapse may be caused by a tumor in the pelvic cavity.Smoking (which causes chronic cough) and genetics also may play a role. Women of Northern European descent have a higher incidence of uterine prolapse than do women of Asian and African descent.Symptoms tend to be minimal with 1st-degree uterine prolapse.

",Chest x-ray,Pulmonary function tests,V/Q Scan,Arteriogram,,,1,"Superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) is a collection of symptoms caused by the partial blockage or compression of the superior vena cava, the major vein that carries blood from the head, neck, upper chest, and arms to the heart. Nearly 95% of SVCS cases are caused by cancer.The most common symptoms are these: problems breathing, coughing and swelling in the face, neck, upper body, and arms.Approximately 90% of cases are associated with a cancerous tumor that is compressing the superior vena cava. A chest x-ray usually shows a mediastinal mass (tumor) that is compressing the superior vena cava.",,
348,4,Pediatrics,"A 1 year old child presents for the 5th time with symptoms of pain when he urinates, fever and back/flank pain. What is the most likely diagnosis? ",Ureteropelvic junction obstruction,Vesicoureteral reflux,Renal agenesis,UTI,,,2,"Vesicoureteral reflux is retrograde passage of urine from the bladder back into the ureter and renal pelvis. This may damage the upper urinary tract by bacterial infection and occasionally by increased hydrostatic pressure. Bacteria in the lower urinary tract can easily be transmitted by reflux to the upper tract, leading to recurrent parenchymal infection with potential scarring and renal dysfunction. Chronically elevated emptying pressures ( 40 cm H2O) and increased bladder volume and pressure often cause progressive kidney damage, even without infection or reflux.Symptoms and signs are typically those of UTI; these may include fever, abdominal or flank pain, dysuria or flank pain with voiding, frequency, and urgency. Pyuria, hematuria, proteinuria, and bacteriuria may be present on urinalysis.Tests for reflux include filling and voiding cystourethrogram (which is best to diagnose bladder outlet obstruction) and radioisotope cystogram. Renal ultrasonography evaluates for size, hydronephrosis, and scarring.Vesicoureteral reflux is usually mild to moderate. Mild cases often resolve spontaneously over months to several years while daily antibacterial prophylaxis is maintained.",,
349,1,Medicine,A 78 year old man develops prostate cancer and is also found to have metastasis. Which of the following is not an appropriate treatment? ,Androgen deprivation,Castration,Leuprolide,Watchful waiting,Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists,,4,"Patients with a locally advanced tumor or metastases may benefit from androgen deprivation by castration, either surgically with bilateral orchiectomy or medically with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, such as leuprolide. Radical prostatectomy (removal of prostate with adnexal structures and regional lymph nodes) is probably best for patients  70 with a tumor confined to the prostate. Most patients, regardless of age, prefer definitive therapy. Watchful waiting may be appropriate for asymptomatic patients  70 with localized prostate cancer.",,
350,1,Medicine,A 43 year old woman with severe abdominal pain that radiates to her back is found to have high amylase and lipase levels. Which of the following is not part of the treatment of this illness? ,Analgesics,Antibiotics,NPO status,IV fluids,,,2,"Acute pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas (and, sometimes, adjacent tissues) caused by the release of activated pancreatic enzymes. The most common triggers are biliary tract disease and chronic heavy alcohol intake. The condition ranges from mild (abdominal pain and vomiting) to severe (pancreatic necrosis and a systemic inflammatory process with shock and multiorgan failure). Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and serum amylase and lipase levels. Treatment is supportive, with IV fluids, analgesics (morphine), and fasting (NPO status). Antibiotics are not used in the treatment of acute pancreatitis.",,
351,1,Medicine,"A 53 year old woman with history of &lsquo;wetting herself' presents with dysuria and lower abdominal pain. She is noticed to have a 12cm x 12cm mass, that is palpable in her lower abdomen. What is the most likely cause of her presentation? ",Ovarian tumor,Urinary retention,UTI,Uterine fibroids,,,2,"Urinary retention is incomplete emptying of the bladder or cessation of urination; it may be acute or chronic. Causes include impaired bladder contractility, bladder outlet obstruction, detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (lack of coordination between bladder contraction and sphincter relaxation), or a combination. Retention is most common among men, in whom prostate abnormalities or urethral strictures cause outlet obstruction. In either sex, retention may be due to drugs (particularly those with anticholinergic effects, including many OTC drugs), severe fecal impaction (which increases pressure on the bladder trigone), or neurogenic bladder in patients with diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, or prior pelvic surgery resulting in bladder denervation.Urinary retention can cause urinary frequency and urge or overflow incontinence. It may cause abdominal distention and pain. When retention develops slowly, pain may be absent. Long-standing retention predisposes to UTI and can increase bladder pressure, causing obstructive uropathy.Diagnosis is obvious in patients who cannot void. In those who can void, diagnosis is by postvoid catheterization showing a residual urine volume &gt; 100 mL. Relief of acute urinary retention requires urethral catheterization. Subsequent treatment depends on cause. In men with benign prostatic hypertrophy, drugs (usually &alpha;-adrenergic blockers or 5&alpha;-reductase inhibitors) or surgery may help decrease bladder outlet resistance.",,
352,5,Psychiatry,A 33 year old man is unable to leave his city to do his business because of fear. This has affected his job as an executive. What is the most likely diagnosis? ,Anxiety disorder with agoraphobia,Pseudodementia,Depression,OCD,,,1,"Agoraphobia is fear of and anticipatory anxiety about being trapped in situations or places without a way to escape easily and without help if intense anxiety develops. The situations are avoided or they may be endured but with substantial anxiety. Agoraphobia can occur alone or as part of panic disorder.Common examples of situations or places that create fear and anxiety include standing in line at a bank or at a supermarket checkout, sitting in the middle of a long row in a theater or classroom, and using public transportation, such as a bus or an airplane. Some people develop agoraphobia after a panic attack in a typical agoraphobic situation. Others simply feel uncomfortable in such a situation and may never or only later have panic attacks there. Agoraphobia often interferes with function and, if severe enough, can cause people to become housebound.",,
353,1,Medicine,A 25 year old woman with family history of kidney disease is found to be hypertensive and is started on a beta blocker. What is your next step in the work-up of her condition?  ,Urinary metanephrines,Renal doppler ultrasound,CT of abdomen,Serum cortisol,,,2,"This woman, being so young, most likely has high blood pressure from a secondary cause of renal artery stenosis.Renovascular hypertension is blood pressure elevation due to partial or complete occlusion of one or more renal arteries or their branches. It is usually asymptomatic unless long-standing. A bruit can be heard over one or both renal arteries in  50% of patients. Diagnosis is by physical examination and renal imaging with duplex ultrasonography, radionuclide imaging, or magnetic resonance angiography. Angiography is done before definitive treatment with surgery or angioplasty.",,
354,4,Pediatrics,A very obese 12 year old boy is brought in because he has developed a limp when he walks. He also complains of some hip pain. What is the most likely diagnosis? ,Osgood-Schlatter,Avascular necrosis of femoral head,Slipped capital femoral epiphysis,Legg calve perthes disease,,,3,"Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) usually occurs in early adolescence and preferentially affects boys. Obesity is a significant risk factor. Genetic factors also contribute. Exact cause is unknown but probably relates to weakening of the physis (growth plate), which can result from trauma, hormonal changes, inflammation, or increased shearing forces due to obesity.Onset is usually insidious, and symptoms are associated with stage of slippage. The 1st symptom may be hip stiffness that abates with rest; it is followed by a limp, then hip pain that radiates down the anteromedial thigh to the knee. Up to 15% of patients present with knee or thigh pain, and the true problem (hip) may be missed until slippage worsens. Early hip examination may detect neither pain nor limitation of movement. In more advanced stages, findings may include pain during movement of the affected hip, with limited flexion, abduction, and medial rotation; knee pain without specific knee abnormalities; and a limp. The affected leg is externally rotated. If blood supply to the area is compromised, avascular necrosis and collapse of the epiphysis may occur.Because treatment of advanced slippage is difficult, early diagnosis is vital. Anteroposterior and frog-leg lateral x-rays of both hips are taken. X-rays show widening of the epiphyseal line or apparent posterior and inferior displacement of the femoral head. SCFE usually progresses; it requires surgery as soon as it is diagnosed. Patients should not bear weight on the affected leg until SCFE has been ruled out or treated. Surgical treatment consists of screw fixation through the epiphysis.",,
355,1,Medicine,"During the physical exam of a patient's foot, you notice an inability to dorsiflex. What nerve is most likely affected? ",L1,L2,L3,L4,,,4,"&lsquo;Foot Drop' describes a disorder that affects the patient's ability to raise their foot at the ankle. It is further characterized by an inability to point the toes toward the body (dorsiflexion) or move the foot at the ankle inward or outward. Pain, weakness, and numbness may accompany loss of function.Drop foot is not a disease but a symptom of an underlying problem. Depending on the cause, drop foot may be temporary or permanent. Often drop foot is caused by injury to the peroneal nerve deep within the lumbar and sacral spine. The peroneal nerve is a division of the sciatic nerve. The peroneal nerve runs along the outside of the lower leg (below the knee) and branches off into each ankle, foot, and first two toes. It innervates or transmits signals to muscle groups responsible for ankle, foot, and toe movement and sensation. The peroneal nerve is susceptible to different types of injury. Some of these include nerve compression from lumbar disc herniation (e.g. L4, L5, S1).",,
356,1,Medicine,"A 55 year old man who is a smoker, comes in with a complaint of pain in his right calf. He says that it comes and goes and happens when he walks up a flight of stairs. What is the next step to diagnose your suspicion of intermittent claudication? ",MRI of leg,V/Q Scan,CT of lumbar spine,Ankle Brachial index,,,4,"Intermittent claudication, the most common symptom of peripheral arterial disease, results from gradual narrowing of a leg artery. It is a painful, aching, cramping, or tired feeling in the muscles of the leg, not in the joints. Intermittent claudication occurs regularly and predictably during physical activity but is always relieved promptly by rest. The muscles ache when a person walks, and the pain begins more quickly and is more severe when the person walks quickly or uphill. Usually, after 1 to 5 minutes of rest (sitting is not necessary), the person can walk the same distance already covered, although continued walking will again provoke the pain at a comparable distance. Most commonly, the pain occurs in the calf, but it can also occur in the thigh, hip, or buttock, depending on the location of the blockage. The ankle-brachial index is an effective screening tool. The ankle-brachial index is calculated by dividing the ankle pressure (the higher of the posterior tibial artery pressures) by the brachial systolic pressure (the higher of the two arm pressures). An ankle-brachial index below 0.95 at rest or following exercise is considered abnormal. An ankle-brachial index between 0.8 and 0.5 is consistent with intermittent claudication, and an index of less than 0.5 indicates severe disease.",,
357,1,Medicine,Which of the following is the most important step in the management of peripheral arterial disease? ,Diabetic control,Blood pressure control,Exercise,Smoking cessation,Correction of dyslipidemia,,4,"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common circulatory problem in which narrowed arteries reduce the blood flow to the limbs.Risk factors for PVD include smoking, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and hyperviscosity. Other etiologies for developing PVD may include phlebitis, injury or surgery, and autoimmune disease, including vasculitides, arthritis, or coagulopathy.Most people with PAD can be treated with lifestyle changes, medications or both. Lifestyle changes to lower the risk include: stop smoking (single most important modifiable cause of PAD; smokers have a particularly strong risk of PAD), control diabetes, control blood pressure, be physically active (including a supervised exercise program), eat a low-saturated-fat, low-cholesterol diet.",,
358,1,Medicine,What is the first sign in impending foot gangrene?  ,Rest pain,Shiny and dry skin,Loss of hair,Loss of sensation,,,1,"Chronic critical limb ischemia is manifested by pain at rest, nonhealing wounds and gangrene. Ischemic rest pain is typically described as a burning pain in the arch or distal foot that occurs while the patient is recumbent but is relieved when the patient returns to a position in which the feet are dependent. Intervention may include conservative therapy, revascularization or amputation. Progressive gangrene, rapidly enlarging wounds or continuous ischemic rest pain can signify a threat to the limb and suggest the need for revascularization in patients without prohibitive operative risks. Bypass grafts are usually required because of the multilevel and distal nature of the arterial narrowing in critical limb ischemia. Patients with diabetes are more likely than other patients to have distal disease that is less amenable to bypass grafting. Compared with amputation, revascularization is more cost-effective and is associated with better perioperative morbidity and mortality. Limb preservation should be the goal in most patients with critical limb ischemia.",,
359,1,Medicine,A woman complains of early morning headache. She also has vomited a few times and has nystagmus. This has been going on for 6 months. What is the next step in your investigation? ,Referral to eye specialist,CT of head,EEG,Temporal artery biopsy,,,2,"Many symptoms result from increased intracranial pressure. The most common is headache. Headache may be most intense when patients awake from deep non-REM sleep (usually several hours after falling asleep) because hypoventilation, which increases cerebral blood flow and thus intracranial pressure, is usually maximal during non-REM sleep. When intracranial pressure is very high, the headache may be accompanied by vomiting, which may occur with little preceding nausea. Papilledema develops in about 25% of patients with a brain tumor but may be absent even if intracranial pressure is increased. In infants and very young children, increased intracranial pressure may enlarge the head. If intracranial pressure increases sufficiently, brain herniation occurs.If an intracranial mass is suspected, a CT or MRI of the head/brain should be done.",,
360,3,PMCH,What is the most important advice to give to a traveler to prevent transmission of cholera? ,Do not use public washrooms,Hand washing,Avoid taking ice water that has not been boiled,Immunization,Do not eat meat,,3,"Cholera is an acute infection of the small bowel by Vibrio cholerae, which secretes a toxin that produces copious watery diarrhea, leading to dehydration, oliguria, and collapse. Infection is typically through contaminated water or seafood. Diagnosis is by culture or serology. Treatment is vigorous rehydration and electrolyte replacement along with doxycycline. To control cholera, human excrement must be properly disposed of and water supplies purified. Drinking water should be boiled or chlorinated and vegetables and fish cooked thoroughly.",,
361,2,OBGYN,"A 17 year old girl complains of severe bleeding during her menstrual cycle. She uses 20 tampons per cycle, and it lasts for 7 days and comes every 2 months. What is the most appropriate management? ",NSAIDS,Iron,Use more tampons/pads,OCP,,,4,"Menorrhagia is a term used to define menstrual periods lasting longer than seven days. Drug therapy for menorrhagia may include:Iron supplements: If the condition is accompanied by anemia, your doctor may recommend that you take iron supplements regularly. If your iron levels are low but you're not yet anemic, you may be started on iron supplements rather than waiting until you become anemic. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) help reduce menstrual blood loss. NSAIDs have the added benefit of relieving painful menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea). Oral contraceptives (OCP's): Aside from providing effective birth control, oral contraceptives can help regulate ovulation and reduce episodes of excessive or prolonged menstrual bleeding.",,
362,4,Pediatrics,"An infant female's serum chemistry profile shows hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. On physical examination, she was found to have ambiguous external genitalia. What is the most likely diagnosis? ",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,Trisomy 18,Conn's syndrome,Hypothyroidism (cretinism),,,1,"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a group of genetic disorders, each characterized by inadequate synthesis of cortisol, aldosterone, or both. The salt-wasting form causes hyponatremia (sometimes severe), hyperkalemia, and hypotension as well as virilization. If undiagnosed and untreated, this form can lead to life-threatening adrenal crisis, with vomiting, diarrhea, hypoglycemia, hypovolemia, and shock.Very young female infants with the salt-wasting form will have ambiguous external genitals, with clitoral enlargement, fusion of the labia majora, and a urogenital sinus rather than distinct urethral and vaginal openings. Male infants typically have normal sexual development. When the enzyme deficiency is much milder, neonates have little or no virilization, but androgen excess manifests later with early appearance of pubic hair and increase in growth velocity in both sexes, clitoral enlargement in girls, and penile enlargement and earlier deepening of voice in boys.",,
363,2,OBGYN,A 28 year old pregnant woman develops sudden onset of dyspnea and tachycardia. Which one of the following is the most likely explanation?  ,Acute mitral valve regurgitation,Pulmonary embolism,Myocardial infarction,Acute respiratory distress syndrome,Lobar pneumonia,,2,"Thromboembolic disease is the leading cause of death in pregnant women. In thromboembolic disease, blood clots form in blood vessels. They may travel through the bloodstream and block an artery. The risk of developing thromboembolic disease is increased for about 6 to 8 weeks after delivery. Most complications due to blood clots result from injuries that occur during delivery. The risk is much greater after a cesarean section than after vaginal delivery.Blood clots usually form in the superficial veins of the legs as thrombophlebitis or in the deep veins as deep vein thrombosis. Symptoms include swelling, pain in the calves, and tenderness. The severity of the symptoms does not correlate with the severity of the disease. A clot can move from the legs to the lungs, where it may block one or more arteries in the lungs. This blockage, called pulmonary embolism, can be life threatening. If pulmonary embolism is suspected, a lung ventilation and perfusion scan may be performed to confirm the diagnosis.",,
364,1,Medicine,"A 50 year old man comes to the emergency room with a history of vomiting for three days' duration. His past history reveals that for approximately 20 years, he has been getting epigastric pain, lasting for two to three weeks. He remembers getting relief from pain by taking milk and antacids. Physical examination showed a fullness in the epigastric area with visible peristalsis, absence of tenderness and normal active bowel sounds. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  ",Gastric outlet obstruction,Small bowel obstruction,Volvulus of the colon,Incarcerated umbilical hernia,Cholecystitis,,1,"Intrinsic or extrinsic obstruction of the pyloric channel or duodenum is the usual pathophysiology of gastric outlet obstruction (GOO). Nausea and vomiting are the cardinal symptoms of GOO. Vomiting usually is described as nonbilious, and it characteristically contains undigested food particles. In the early stages of obstruction, vomiting may be intermittent and usually occurs within 1 hour of a meal.Early satiety and epigastric fullness are common. Weight loss is frequent when the condition approaches chronicity and is most significant in patients with malignant disease. Abdominal pain is not frequent. Physical examination often demonstrates the presence of chronic dehydration and malnutrition. A dilated stomach may be appreciated as a tympanitic mass in the epigastric area and/or left upper quadrant.Plain abdominal radiographs, contrast upper GI studies (Gastrografin or barium), and CT scans with oral contrast are helpful. Plain radiographs, including the obstruction series (ie, supine abdomen, upright abdomen, chest posteroanterior), can demonstrate the presence of gastric dilatation and may be helpful in distinguishing the differential diagnosis.Upper endoscopy can help visualize the gastric outlet and may provide a tissue diagnosis when the obstruction is intraluminal. Treatment is surgical.",,

Which of the following is most likely to have been injured?  ,Axillary nerve,Median nerve,Ulnar nerve,Radial nerve,Brachial plexus / triceps muscle,q294.jpg,2,"Carpal tunnel syndrome is compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist. Symptoms include pain of the hand and wrist associated with tingling and numbness, classically distributed along the median nerve (the palmar side of the thumb, the index and middle fingers, and the radial half of the ring finger) but possibly involving the entire hand. Typically, the patient wakes at night with burning or aching pain and with numbness and tingling and shakes the hand to obtain relief and restore sensation. Thenar atrophy and weakness of thumb opposition and abduction may develop late. The diagnosis is strongly suggested by Tinel's sign, in which median nerve paresthesias are reproduced by tapping at the volar surface of the wrist over the site of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. Reproduction of tingling with wrist flexion (Phalen's sign) is also suggestive. However, clinical differentiation from other types of peripheral neuropathy may sometimes be difficult. If symptoms are severe or the diagnosis is uncertain, conduction testing should be performed on the median nerve. Changing the position of computer keyboards and making other ergonomic corrections may provide relief. Otherwise, treatment includes wearing a lightweight neutral wrist splint, especially at night, and using mild analgesics (eg, acetaminophen, NSAIDs). If these measures fail to control symptoms, a corticosteroid be injected into the carpal tunnel at a site just ulnar to the palmaris longus tendon and proximal to the distal crease at the wrist.",,

",Dilated third ventricle,Craniopharyngioma,Saccular aneurysm of the circle of willis,Pituitary adenoma,Meningioma of the tuberculum sellae,,4,"Enlargement of the pituitary gland is usually due to a tumor but may be due to bleeding into the gland or involvement by some other disease, such as tuberculosis or sarcoidosis. An enlarged pituitary gland may produce symptoms such as headaches. Because the growing gland often presses on the optic nerve, which passes above the pituitary gland, loss of vision may occur. Vision loss often initially affects only the upper, outermost fields of vision in both eyes (bitemporal hemianopia). Underproduction or overproduction of pituitary hormones may also occur. Treatment depends on the cause of the enlargement.",,

Insufficient thyroid hormone causes body functions to slow. Symptoms are subtle and develop gradually. They may be mistaken for depression, especially among older people. Facial expressions become dull, the voice is hoarse and speech is slow, eyelids droop, and the eyes and face become puffy. Many people with hypothyroidism gain weight, become constipated, and are unable to tolerate cold.Hypothyroidism is common, especially among older people, particularly women; it affects about 10% of older women. It can, however, occur at any age. Very severe hypothyroidism is called myxedema.Diagnosis is made by obtaining TSH and FreeT4 levels. Treatment is with thyroid replacement with synthroid.",,

",An accessory rib,An iliopsoas muscle spasm,Rhabdomyosarcoma,Scoliosis,Hematoma,q300.jpg,4,"Scoliosis is lateral curvature of the spine. It can be detected in 2 to 3% of children aged 10 to 16 years; 60 to 80% are girls.Scoliosis may first be suspected when one shoulder seems higher than the other or when clothes do not hang straight, but it is often detected during routine physical examination. Patients may initially report fatigue in the lumbar region after prolonged sitting or standing. Muscular backaches in areas of strain (eg, in the lumbosacral angle) may follow.The curve is most pronounced when patients bend forward. Most curves are convex to the right in the thoracic area and to the left in the lumbar area, so that the right shoulder is higher than the left. X-ray examination should include standing anteroposterior and lateral views of the spine.The greater the curve, the greater the likelihood that it will progress after the skeleton matures.

Lithium tremor is an irregular, non-rhythmic twitching of the arms and legs that is variable in both intensity and frequency. Lithium-induced tremor occurs in approximately half of persons taking this medication. The chance of tremor decreases if the dose is reduced. Acute lithium toxicity (poisoning) can result in neurological side effects, ranging from confusion and coordination impairment, to coma, seizures, and death. Other neurological side effects associated with lithium therapy include lethargy, memory impairment, difficulty finding words, and loss of creativity.About 30 to 35% of patients experience excessive thirst and urination, usually due to the inability of the kidneys to retain water and sodium. However, lithium is not known to cause kidney damage.Lithium inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormone.

Patients do not fall or convulse; they abruptly stop activity, then just as abruptly resume it, with no postictal symptoms or knowledge that a seizure has occurred. Absence seizures are genetic and occur predominantly in children. Without treatment, such seizures are likely to occur many times a day. Seizures often occur when patients are sitting quietly, can be precipitated by hyperventilation, and rarely occur during exercise. Atypical absence seizures last longer, are accompanied by more pronounced jerking or automatic movements, and cause less complete loss of awareness. Treatment is with ethosuximide and also with valproic acid.",,

People with celiac disease must exclude all gluten from their diet, since eating even small amounts may cause symptoms. The response to a gluten-free diet is usually rapid. Once gluten is avoided, the brushlike surface of the small intestine and its absorptive function return to normal. Gluten is so widely used in food products that people with celiac disease need detailed lists of foods to be avoided and expert advice from a dietitian. Gluten is found, for example, in commercial soups, sauces, ice cream, and hot dogs.Several grains and starch sources are considered acceptable for a gluten-free diet. The most frequently used are corn, potatoes and rice.",,

Passive-aggressive personality disorder is a long-term (chronic) condition in which a person seems to actively comply with the desires and needs of others, but actually passively resists them. In the process, the person becomes increasingly hostile and angry. People with this disorder resent responsibility and show it through their behaviors, rather than by openly expressing their feelings. They often use procrastination, inefficiency, and forgetfulness to avoid doing what they need to do or have been told by others to do.B. Histrionic personality disorder is one of a group of conditions called dramatic personality disorders. People with this disorder have intense, unstable emotions and distorted self-images. They have an overwhelming desire to be noticed, and often behave dramatically or inappropriately to get attention.D. People with avoidant personality disorder are preoccupied with their own shortcomings. They form relationships with others only if they believe they will not be rejected. Loss and rejection are so painful that these people will choose to be lonely rather than risk trying to connect with others.E. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is a condition in which a person is preoccupied with rules, orderliness, and control. ",,

A common type of distal median nerve dysfunction is carpal tunnel syndrome.Distal median nerve dysfunction occurs when the nerve is inflamed, trapped, or injured by trauma. Trapping (entrapment) involves pressure on the nerve where it passes through a narrow area. Wrist fractures may injure the median nerve directly or may increase the risk for trapping a nerve later on.Sensation changes of the thumb and first 2 fingers, numbness, decreased sensation, tingling, burning sensation, waking up at night with wrist or hand pain (may be severe), weakness of the hand, dropping things and difficulty grasping objects.-Weakness on wrist extension is more indicative of radial nerve or C7 nerve root involvement-Atrophy in the first dorsal interosseous muscle is seen in compression of the ulnar nerve-Numbness over the fifth digit is seen in ulnar nerve entrapment-Froment's sign: Assessing ulnar nerve damage.

Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and serum amylase and lipase levels. Treatment is supportive, with IV fluids, analgesics, and fasting.",,
408,1,Medicine,"A 22 year old male, working as a waiter in a nightclub, noticed a gradual hearing loss. He admitted that the noise level in his job is very high and that he was not advised to wear ear protection. Which one of the following does he most likely suffer from?  ",Sensory hearing loss and vertigo,Both sensory and conductive hearing loss,Conductive hearing loss and ataxia,Sensory hearing loss and tinnitus,Conductive hearing loss and nystagmus,,4,"When we are exposed to harmful noise, sounds that are too loud or loud sounds that last a long time, sensitive structures in our inner ear can be damaged, causing noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Continuous exposure to loud noise also can damage the structure of hair cells, resulting in hearing loss and tinnitus, although the process occurs more gradually than for impulse noise. NIHL is 100 percent preventable. All individuals should understand the hazards of noise and how to practice good hearing health in everyday life. To protect your hearing: Know which noises can cause damage (those at or above 85 decibels). Wear earplugs or other hearing protective devices when involved in a loud activity.",,

He is confused and on examination is noted to have palsies of conjugate gaze, horizontal nystagmus, and ataxia. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  ",Conversion reaction,Alcohol intoxication,Alcohol hallucinosis,Delirium tremens,Wernicke's encephalopathy,,5,"Wernicke's encephalopathy is a disorder characterized by acute onset of confusion, nystagmus, partial ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia due to thiamin deficiency. Diagnosis is primarily clinical. The disorder may remit with treatment, persist, or degenerate into Korsakoff's psychosis. Treatment consists of thiamine and supportive measures. Wernicke's encephalopathy results from inadequate intake or absorption of thiamine plus continued carbohydrate ingestion. Severe alcoholism is a common underlying condition. Excessive alcohol intake interferes with thiamine absorption from the GI tract and hepatic storage of thiamine; the poor nutrition associated with alcoholism often precludes adequate thiamine intake. Wernicke's encephalopathy may also result from other conditions that cause prolonged undernutrition or vitamin deficiency (eg, recurrent dialysis, hyperemesis, starvation, gastric plication, cancer, AIDS).",,
411,1,Medicine,"A 71 year old woman with a history of coronary artery disease presents to her family physician for a routine check-up. The physician notices that she has lost 10 kg since her last visit 6 months ago. When questioned, she gives a history of intermittent periumbilical pain that always begins 30 minutes after eating and lasts about 2 hours. She claims that the pain is worse after large meals and so she has begun to eat less out of fear of pain. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  ",Pancreatitis,Cholecystitis,Small bowel obstruction,Intestinal ischemia,Diverticulitis,,4,"A diminished blood flow to the small intestine or colon is called intestinal ischemia. Chronic intestinal ischemia, in which blood flow to the intestines is reduced over time, is characterized by: -abdominal cramps or fullness, beginning within 30 minutes after eating and lasting one to three hours. -abdominal pain that gets progressively worse over weeks or months. -fear of eating because of subsequent pain. -unintended weight loss.An angiography involves guiding a catheter through an artery in groin up into the aorta and injecting a dye (radiographic contrast medium). Although invasive, angiography has traditionally been considered the gold standard in evaluating mesenteric ischemia. Its advantage is that it allows for simultaneous removal of a blood clot through the catheter or administration of medications to improve intestinal blood flow.",,

","Painful, moveable mass","Painless, moveable mass",Blood nipple discharge,Clear nipple discharge,Breast skin edema with dimpling,,5,"Most breast cancers are discovered as a lump by the patient or during routine physical examination or mammography. Less commonly, the presenting symptom is breast pain or enlargement or a nondescript thickening in the breast. A common finding during physical examination is a dominant mass, a lump distinctly different from the surrounding breast tissue. Diffuse fibrotic changes in a quadrant of the breast, usually the upper outer quadrant, are more characteristic of benign disorders; a slightly firmer thickening in one breast but not the other may be a sign of cancer. More advanced breast cancers are characterized by fixation of the lump to the chest wall or to overlying skin, by satellite nodules or ulcers in the skin, or by exaggeration of the usual skin markings resulting from lymphedema (so-called peau d'orange).",,
413,1,Medicine,A 68 year old man presents with cardiac arrest due to ventricular rupture.

Plaque rupture with subsequent exposure of the basement membrane results in platelet aggregation, thrombus formation, fibrin accumulation, hemorrhage into the plaque, and varying degrees of vasospasm. This can result in partial or complete occlusion of the vessel and subsequent myocardial ischemia. Total occlusion of the vessel for more than 4-6 hours results in irreversible myocardial necrosis, but reperfusion within this period can salvage the myocardium and reduce morbidity and mortality.",,
414,1,Medicine,A 49 year old man who smokes two packs of cigarettes a day presents with a lung mass on x-ray and recent weight gain. Laboratory examination shows hyponatremia with hyperosmolar urine. The patient probably has which one of the following diagnoses?  ,Renal failure,Pituitary failure,Conn's syndrome,Cardiac failure,Inappropriate ADH (secretion),,5,"SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone) is a common paraneoplastic syndrome that affects the endocrine system. This syndrome is most often associated with small-cell lung cancer; however, other cancers such as brain tumors, leukemia, lymphoma, colon, prostate, and head and neck cancers can lead to SIADH. SIADH is caused by the inappropriate production and secretion of arginine vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone (ADH) by tumor cells. Patients with SIADH may not have symptoms, especially in the early stages. When symptoms do occur they are usually related to hyponatremia, which leads to central nervous system toxicity if left untreated. Lab values will show concentrated urine in the presence of plasma hypo-osmolality (hyponatremia).Signs and symptoms associated with hyponatremia include fatigue, anorexia, headache and mild alteration in mental status in early stages. If SIADH remains untreated, symptoms can progress to confusion, delirium, seizures, coma, and death. Treatment approaches for SIADH are to treat the underlying tumor and restriction of fluids. More severe cases may require the administration of medications.",,

He states that the pain can occur at any time, but often occurs late in the day  and is usually accompanied by a bitter taste in his mouth. The pain can be dull, or aching and may last for hours. He is physically active and is carrying a full academic load. The pain is unrelated to exercise and does not restrict his activities. His father and paternal uncle have both had myocardial infarctions within the past year. Physical examination is normal, although the patient appears restless and has a heart rate of 100/min. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  ",Reflux esophagitis,Generalized anxiety disorder,Transient myocardial ischemia,Myocardial infarction,Costochondritis,,1,"Esophagitis is a common medical condition usually caused by gastroesophageal reflux. Less frequent causes of esophagitis include infectious esophagitis (in patients who are immunocompromised), radiation esophagitis, and esophagitis from direct erosive effects of ingested medication or corrosive agents.The most common complaint in patients with esophagitis is heartburn (dyspepsia), a burning sensation in the mid chest caused by contact of stomach acid with inflamed esophageal mucosa. Symptoms often are maximal while the person is supine, bending over, wearing tight clothing, or has eaten a large meal.Water brash is a bitter taste of refluxed gastric contents often associated with heartburn.Other common symptoms of esophagitis include upper abdominal discomfort, nausea, bloating, and fullness. Less common symptoms of esophagitis include dysphagia, odynophagia, cough, hoarseness, wheezing, and hematemesis.The patient may experience chest pain indistinguishable from that of coronary artery disease. Pain is often midsternal with radiation to the neck or arm and may be associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. Chest pain may be relieved with nitrates if esophageal spasm is involved, further confounding diagnostic evaluation.The physical examination usually is not helpful in confirming the diagnosis of uncomplicated esophagitis. However, the examination may reveal other potential sources of chest or abdominal pain.Diagnosis is clinical, sometimes with endoscopy, with or without acid testing. Treatment involves lifestyle modification, acid suppression using proton pump inhibitors, and sometimes surgical repair. ",,

Which of the following diagnosis is of most immediate concern?  ",Tardive dyskinesia,Viral meningitis,Neuroleptic malignant syndrome,Ruptured cerebral aneurysm,Unsuspected opioid dependence,,3,"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a hypermetabolic reaction to antipsychotics, particularly dopamine-receptor antagonists (eg thiothixene), although any antipsychotic can be involved. This syndrome usually occurs early in treatment or after an increase in dosage and rarely during maintenance treatment unless other physical conditions such as dehydration occur. It develops in up to 3% of patients started on antipsychotics. Risk is increased in agitated males who have received large and rapidly increased doses. No genetic component is apparent. Its pathophysiologic basis is believed to be blockade of dopamine D2 receptors.Characteristic signs are lead pipe muscle rigidity, hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, hypertension, tachypnea, change in mental status, confusion, and diaphoresis. Common complications include MI, aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, acidosis, and rhabdomyolysis. Less common complications include thromboembolism and renal failure.

In the later stages, carbon dioxide levels increase and oxygen levels fall.The decrease in oxygen levels in the blood stimulates the bone marrow to send more red blood cells into the bloodstream, a condition known as secondary polycythemia. The decrease in oxygen levels in the blood also increases the pressure in the artery through which blood flows from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary artery).",,
435,1,Medicine,"While being investigated for long-standing hypertension, a 55 year old woman is found to have the following serum laboratory test values: normal creatinine, total protein, albumin, and globulin; increased calcium and alkaline phosphatase, and decreased phosphorus. Which of the following do these findings suggest the presence of?  ",Carcinoma metastatic to bone,Excessive dietary calcium intake,Multiple myeloma,Parathyroid adenoma,Sarcoidosis,,4,Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually the result of a single benign adenoma. It is a cause of secondary hypertension. Elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in the setting of hypercalcemia establish the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism. A decreased serum phosphate level may be seen. Increased bone turnover may be reflected in elevated levels of markers of bone formation (alkaline phosphatase) and bone resorption (urinary pyridinoline).,,

These have been getting more frequent and she is finding it increasingly difficult to leave her home. Which one of the following should form part of her treatment?  ,Psychodynamic therapy,Interpersonal psychotherapy,Family therapy,Crisis intervention,Cognitive behavioral therapy,,5,"A panic attack is the sudden onset of a discrete, brief period of intense discomfort, anxiety, or fear accompanied by somatic or cognitive symptoms. Panic disorder is occurrence of repeated panic attacks typically accompanied by fears about future attacks or changes in behavior to avoid situations that might predispose to attacks. Diagnosis is clinical. Isolated panic attacks may not require treatment. Panic disorder is treated with drug therapy, psychotherapy (eg, exposure therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy), or both.Cognitive-behavioral therapy involves teaching patients to recognize and control their distorted thinking and false beliefs and to modify their behavior so that it is more adaptive. For example, if patients describe acceleration of their heart rate or shortness of breath in certain situations or places and fear that they are having a heart attack, they are taught the following: not to avoid those situations, to understand that their worries are unfounded and to respond instead with slow, controlled breathing or other methods that promote relaxation.",,

Breath sounds are normal on the right side. The patient has  ",Tension pneumothorax,Massive hemothorax,Flail chest,Ruptured bronchus,Obstructed mainstem bronchus,,2,"In a hemothorax blood from damaged intercostal, pleural, mediastinal, and sometimes lung parenchymal vessels enters the pleural cavity. Depending on the amount of bleeding and the underlying cause, hemothorax may be associated with varying degrees of lung collapse and mediastinal shift. It usually results from blunt or penetrating chest trauma. Hemothorax may result from thoracic surgery, pulmonary infarction, neoplasm, dissecting thoracic aneurysm, or anticoagulant therapy. Lung percussion reveals dullness, and auscultation reveals decreased to absent breath sounds over the affected side. Symptoms include chest pain, tachypnea, mild to severe dyspnea (difficulty breathing) may be present. If respiratory failure results, the patient may appear anxious, restless, possibly stuporous, and cyanotic. Marked blood loss produces hypotension and shock.

The most appropriate management is to: ",Give oxygen,Intubate the trachea and ventilate the baby,Ventilate with bag and mask,Aspirate the baby's gastric contents,Suction trachea under direct vision,,5,"Meconium is a thick, green, tar like substance that lines the baby's intestines during pregnancy. Typically this substance is not released in the baby's bowel movements until after birth. However, occasionally you will find that the baby will have a bowel movement prior to birth, excreting the meconium into the amniotic fluid.One of the concerns when there is meconium present in the amniotic fluid is that the baby will aspirate the meconium during the labor or birth. This aspiration of meconium is dealt with by vigorous suctioning immediately upon the birth of the baby's head, even before the body is born. This can lessen the amount of meconium available for the baby to aspirate.",,

A person can be infected with tuberculosis only from another person who has active disease. Touching someone who has the disease does not spread it, because the bacteria are transmitted only through the air. Mycobacterium bovis, a bacterium that can live in animals, is an exception. In developing countries, children become infected with it by drinking unpasteurized milk from infected cattle.People with active tuberculosis in their lungs contaminate the air with bacteria when they cough, sneeze, or even speak. These bacteria can stay in the air for several hours. If another person breathes them in, that person may become infected. People who have latent disease or tuberculosis that is not in their lungs do not spread bacteria into the air and cannot transmit the infection.",,

This leads to cell death from oxygen starvation, hypoxia. Because of this it may lead to cardiac arrest (or circulatory arrest) which is an acute cessation of cardiac pump function.Cardiogenic shock is defined by sustained hypotension with tissue hypoperfusion despite adequate left ventricular filling pressure. Signs of tissue hypoperfusion include oliguria (30 mL/h), cool extremities, and altered mentation. Hypotension due to decrease in cardiac output.

The most likely diagnosis is:  ",Otitis media,Urinary tract infection,Milk allergy,Pyloric stenosis,Gastroesophageal reflux,,5,"Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) occurs when stomach contents reflux, or back up, into the esophagus during or after a meal. The esophagus is the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. A ring of muscle at the bottom of the esophagus opens and closes to allow food to enter the stomach. This ring of muscle is called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The LES normally opens to release gas after meals. With infants, when the LES opens, stomach contents often reflux into the esophagus and out the mouth, resulting in regurgitation, or spitting up, and vomiting. GER can also occur when babies cough, cry, or strain.GER is common in healthy infants.

A stool study for ova and parasites is most appropriate at this time. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause.,,
473,4,Pediatrics,A 6 year old girl is going to summer camp. Her parents come to your office seeking advice as she had a severe reaction to a honey bee sting 2 years ago. Which one of the following recommendations should be given? ,"If stung, the child should be given an antihistamine then be observed",Self-administered epinephrine should be carried by the child at all times,The child should eat indoors at all times,The child should wear insect repellent,,,2,"Anaphylaxis is an acute, life-threatening, IgE-mediated allergic reaction that occurs in previously sensitized people when they are re-exposed to the sensitizing antigen. Symptoms include stridor, dyspnea, wheezing, and hypotension. Diagnosis is clinical. Bronchospasm and upper airway edema are treated with inhaled or injected &beta;-agonists and sometimes endotracheal intubation. Hypotension requires IV fluids and vasopressors. Epinephrine is the cornerstone of treatment and should be given immediately. It can be given SC or IM. An self injectable &ldquo;epinephrine pen' can be carried by patients with them at all times.",,
474,1,Medicine,"A 48 year old woman with a history of deep venous thrombosis is taking warfarin (Coumadin), 10 mg once daily, and is maintaining an International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.75. She started taking high doses of garlic and would like to know if she can continue to take it. She has blood in her nares and multiple bruises on her extremities that began after she started taking the garlic. Which one of the following statements is correct?  ",She can continue to take the garlic because her INR is appropriate,interaction with garlic should be suspected despite an appropriate INR,Garlic does not pose a risk of drug interactions and she can continue taking it,Garlic in combination with warfarin poses serious risk of cerebral hemorrhage and should be stopped immediately,,,4,"Garlic is thought to provide several cardiovascular benefits, such as blood pressure lowering, serum lipid lowering, and antithrombotic activity. Garlic oil has been reported to interrupt thromboxane synthesis, thereby inhibiting platelet function. There have been reports of spontaneous epidural hematoma after ingesting approximately 2000 mg of garlic daily (equivalent to about four cloves) for an undetermined period. The available information suggests that a serious interaction is possible. Patients taking warfarin should be advised to avoid garlic supplements. However, they should also be aware that regular ingestion of food products containing small amounts of garlic should not pose a problem. If excessive garlic consumption and warfarin use occur concomitantly, the patient's INR should be closely monitored.",,
475,5,Psychiatry,"A 62 year old man with a history of depression has been self-treating his symptoms with St. John's wort for one week. His medical history includes hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension, for which he is taking atorvastatin (Lipitor), digoxin, warfarin, and verapamil (Calan). Which one of the following statements is correct?  ",The patient's digoxin level should be checked immediately because St. John's wort has been suspected to increase the digoxin level and cause toxicity,The patient's warfarin dosage should be decreased because St. John's wort can cause an increase in INR,The patient's atorvastatin dosage should be decreased because of increased blood levels,The patient's verapamil dosage should be increased if blood pressure is not well controlled,,,4,"St. John's Wort may increase the breakdown of verapamil in the stomach, causing a decreased effect of verapamil. It is best to avoid using St. John's Wort while taking Verapamil. If these products must be used together, you may need to adjust the dose of verapamil especially when St. John's Wort is either started or stopped.St John's Wort may decrease verapamil levels, therefore caution is advised when these two medicines are used together.",,
476,1,Medicine,Which one of the following is least associated with Behcet's syndrome? ,Mouth ulcers,Genital ulcers,Conjunctivitis,Deep vein thrombosis,Viral meningitis,,5,"Beh&ccedil;et's syndrome is a multisystem, inflammatory, relapsing, chronic vasculitic disorder. Common manifestations include recurrent oral ulcers, ocular inflammation, genital ulcers, and skin lesions. Blindness, neurologic or GI involvement, venous thromboses, and arterial aneurysms are the most serious manifestations.  Neurologic involvement is one of the most serious manifestations of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome, occurring in 10-30% of patients and carrying a poor prognosis. Manifestations include meningitis (aseptic) or meningoencephalitis; psychiatric symptoms, including personality changes; neurological deficits, including hemiparesis; and brainstem symptoms.Diagnosis is clinical using international criteria. Treatment is mainly symptomatic but may involve corticosteroids for acute severe ocular or neurologic involvement or immunosuppressants for severe chronic features. Almost all patients have recurrent painful oral ulcers resembling those of aphthous stomatitis; in most, these ulcers are the first manifestations. Similar ulcers occur on the penis and scrotum, on the vulva where they are painful, or in the vagina where they may cause little or no pain.",,
477,1,Medicine,A young female presents with supraventricular tachycardia. She complains of palpitation and dizziness. The best initial management is: ,IV Verapamil,Cardioversion,Increased vagal tone,Beta blocker,IV Adenosine,,3,"Vagal maneuvers are the first-line treatment in hemodynamically stable patients. Vagal maneuvers, such as breath-holding and the Valsalva maneuver (ie, having the patient bear down as though having a bowel movement), all slow conduction in the AV node and can potentially interrupt the reentrant circuit.Carotid massage is another vagal maneuver that can slow AV nodal conduction. Massage the carotid sinus for several seconds on the nondominant cerebral hemisphere side. This maneuver is usually reserved for young patients. Due to the risk of stroke from emboli, auscultate for bruits before attempting this maneuver. Do not perform carotid massage on both sides. A Valsalva maneuver, if performed properly by the patient, can frequently avert an attack.Synchronized cardioversion starting at 50 J can be used immediately in patients who are hypotensive, have pulmonary edema, have chest pain with ischemia, or are otherwise unstable.When SVT is not terminated by vagal maneuvers, short-term management involves intravenous adenosine.Other alternatives for the acute treatment of SVT include calcium channel blockers like verapamil, diltiazem or beta-blockers like metoprolol or esmolol.

A single parathyroid adenoma is the underlying pathology in 85% of cases.The symptoms have become known as moans, groans, stones, and bones...with psychic overtones. They include feelings of weakness and fatigue, depression, or aches and pains. With more severe disease, a person may have a loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, confusion or impaired thinking and memory, and increased thirst and urination. Patients may have thinning of the bones without symptoms, but with risk of fractures. Elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in the setting of hypercalcemia establish the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism.",,

Most extraintestinal manifestations are more common in UC and Crohn's colitis than in Crohn's disease limited to the small bowel. Extraintestinal manifestations are categorized in three ways:1. Disorders that usually parallel (ie, wax and wane with) IBD flare-ups. These include peripheral arthritis, episcleritis, aphthous stomatitis, erythema nodosum, and pyoderma gangrenosum. One or more of these parallel disorders develops in &gt; 1/3 of patients hospitalized with IBD.2. Disorders that are clearly associated with IBD but appear independently of IBD activity. These include ankylosing spondylitis, sacroiliitis, uveitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Ankylosing spondylitis occurs more commonly in IBD patients with the HLA-B27 antigen. 3. Disorders that are consequences of disrupted bowel physiology. These occur mainly in severe Crohn's disease of the small bowel. Malabsorption may result from extensive ileal resection and produce deficiencies, of fat-soluble vitamins, vitamin B12, or minerals, resulting in anemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, clotting disorders, and bone demineralization.

",Ultrasound,Serum lead level,ERCP,Anti-mitochondrial antibodies,CT of Abdomen,,4,"Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is inflammation with progressive scarring of the bile ducts in the liver. Eventually, the ducts are blocked, the liver becomes scarred, and liver failure develops. PBC is most common among women aged 35 to 70, although it can occur in men and women of any age. An autoimmune reaction is the likely cause of primary biliary cirrhosis. Itchiness, fatigue, a dry mouth and eyes, and jaundice are common. A blood test to measure antimitochondrial antibodies is highly accurate for the diagnosis. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms, slowing liver damage, and treating complications.[Note: If you think about the differential diagnosis for this patient, it would certainly include PBS, autoimmune hepatitis, PSC (or cholangiocarcinoma). First, you want to do the easiest/fastest tests that would give you more info and help you come up with the correct diagnosis: this would be a simple blood test.

What is the most appropriate treatment? ,Surgical repair (banding),Nissen fundoplication,Octreotide,Anti-reflux therapy, Thiamine,,1,"Esophageal varices are extra, swollen veins that develop in the lining of the lower esophagus near the stomach. They are caused by liver disease and are similar to the varicose veins that some people have in their legs. These swollen veins can rupture and cause dangerous bleeding.Esophageal varices almost always occur in people who have cirrhosis of the liver. Cirrhosis causes scarring of the liver, which slows the flow of blood through the liver. This causes blood to back up in the portal vein, the main vein that delivers blood from the stomach and intestines to the liver. This condition is called portal hypertension. The backup of blood forces extra blood vessels to form around the stomach and esophagus. These extra vessels are called esophageal varices. They usually have enlarged, irregularly shaped bulbous regions (varicosities) that are interrupted by narrower regions. Treatment of a massive episode of esophageal varices is via surgical repair (banding or variceal ligation). Banding is a medical procedure which uses elastic bands for constriction. Banding may be used to tie off blood vessels in order to stop bleeding, as in the treatment of bleeding esophageal varices.",,

A severe deficiency may cause tingling or loss of sensation in the hands and feet, muscle weakness, loss of reflexes, difficulty walking, confusion, and dementia.The diagnosis is based on blood tests. A CBC will show macrocytic anemia. When high doses of vitamin B12 supplements are taken, most symptoms resolve. Symptoms due to nerve damage, such as neuropathy or dementia in older people, may persist.Vitamin B12 deficiency develops in people who do not consume any animal products (vegans) unless they take supplements.

What is the most likely diagnosis? ,Asherman syndrome,Uterine fibroids,Ectopic pregnancy,Bicornuate uterus,,,1,"Asherman's Syndrome is an acquired disease which is characterized by the formation of adhesions (scar tissue) in the women's uterus. Asherman's syndrome is the presence of intrauterine adhesions that typically occur as a result of scar formation after uterine surgery, especially after a dilatation and curettage ( D&amp;C ). The adhesions may cause amenorrhea and/or infertility. Ashermans syndrome's patients have scanty or absent periods (amenorrhea) but some have normal periods. Some patients have no periods but feel pain at the time each month that their period would normally arrive. This pain may indicate that menstruation is occurring but the blood cannot exit the uterus because the cervix is blocked by adhesions. Recurrent miscarriage and infertility could also be considered as symptoms. Symptoms may be related to several conditions and are more likely to indicate Asherman's syndrome if they occur suddenly after a D&amp;C or other uterine surgery. Asherman's syndrome should be treated if it is causing infertility or amenorrhea. Surgical treatment includes cutting and removing adhesions or scar tissue within the uterine cavity.",,
501,4,Pediatrics,A 10 year old boy who was out playing in the cold weather develops frost bit on his fingers. The most appropriate treatment for this is:  ,Put hands in warm water for 30 minutes,IV antibiotics,Escharectomy,Debridment,Fasciotomy,,1,"When exposed to very cold temperatures, skin and underlying tissues may freeze, resulting in frostbite. The areas most likely to be affected by frostbite are the hands, feet, nose and ears. You can identify frostbite by the hard, pale and cold quality of skin that has been exposed to the cold. As the area thaws, the flesh becomes red and painful. If fingers, ears or other areas suffer frostbite: warm your hands by tucking them under your arms. If your nose, ears or face is frostbitten, warm the area by covering it with dry, gloved hands. If there's any chance of refreezing, don't thaw out the affected areas. If they're already thawed out, wrap them up so they don't refreeze. Get emergency medical help if numbness remains during warming. If you can't get help immediately, warm severely frostbitten hands or feet in warm, not hot, water. You can warm other frostbitten areas, such as your nose, cheeks or ears, by covering them with your warm hands or by applying warm cloths.",,
502,1,Medicine,Guillain-Barr syndrome is not associated with which of the following? ,Proximal muscle weakness,Areflexia,Infection with C. jejuni,Treatment with antibiotics,,,4,"Guillain-Barr syndrome is an acute, usually rapidly progressive inflammatory polyneuropathy characterized by muscular weakness and mild distal sensory loss. Cause is thought to be autoimmune. In about 23 of patients, the syndrome begins 5 days to 3 weeks after an infectious disorder, surgery, or vaccination. Infection is the trigger in  50% of patients; common pathogens include Campylobacter jejuni, enteric viruses, herpesviruses (including cytomegalovirus and those causing infectious mononucleosis), and Mycoplasma.Flaccid weakness predominates in most patients; it is always more prominent than sensory abnormalities and may be most prominent proximally. Relatively symmetric weakness with paresthesias usually begins in the legs and progresses to the arms, but it occasionally begins in the arms or head. In 90% of patients, weakness is maximal at 3 weeks. Deep tendon reflexes are lost. Sphincters are usually spared. Facial and oropharyngeal muscles are weak in  50% of patients with severe disease. Respiratory paralysis severe enough to require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation occurs in 5 to 10%.Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment includes plasmapheresis, -globulin, and, for severe cases, mechanical ventilation.",,

504,1,Medicine,Which of the following is correct regarding Wernicke's encephalopathy? ,Is not related to korsakoff's psychosis,It has a mortality rate of 70 % to 80 % if untreated,The treatment is thiamine 100 mg PO daily for 5 days,The symptoms include nystagmus and ataxia,,,4,"Thiamine deficiency (causing beriberi) is most common among people subsisting on white rice or highly refined carbohydrates in developing countries and among alcoholics. Symptoms include diffuse polyneuropathy, high-output heart failure, and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Thiamine is given to help diagnose and treat the deficiency.Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which combines Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff's psychosis, occurs in some alcoholics who do not consume foods fortified with thiamine. Wernicke's encephalopathy consists of psychomotor slowing or apathy, nystagmus, ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, impaired consciousness, and, if untreated, coma and death. Korsakoff's psychosis consists of mental confusion, dysphonia, and confabulation with impaired memory of recent events. It probably results from chronic deficiency and may develop after repeated episodes of Wernicke's encephalopathy.For Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, thiamine 50 to 100 mg IM or IV bid must usually be given for several days, followed by 10 to 20 mg once/day until a therapeutic response is obtained. The mortality rate is 10-20%.",,
505,6,Surgery,Which is the most serious complication of the supracondylar fracture of the humerus?,A compartment syndrome of forearm,Failure to heal,Healing in a non anatomic position,Injury into the median nerve,Permanent restriction of the Elbow motion,,1,"With supracondylar fractures, casting these injuries as means of definitive treatment carries risk of compartment syndrome. Compartment syndrome is increased tissue pressure within a closed fascial space, resulting in tissue ischemia. Compartment syndrome is a self-perpetuating cascade of events. It begins with the tissue edema that normally occurs after injury (eg, because of soft-tissue swelling or a hematoma). If edema develops within a closed fascial compartment, typically in the anterior or posterior compartments of the leg, there is little room for tissue expansion, so interstitial (compartmental) pressure increases. As compartmental pressure exceeds about 20 mm Hg, cellular perfusion slows and may ultimately stop. Resultant tissue ischemia further worsens edema in a vicious circle. As ischemia progresses, muscles necrose, sometimes leading to rhabdomyolysis and infections; these complications can cause loss of limb and, if untreated, death. Common causes include fractures and severe contusions. The earliest symptom is pain out of proportion to the severity of injury. Diagnosis is by measuring compartmental pressure. Treatment is fasciotomy.",,

He is noted to be flushed and tremulous by the nurses during the day. The most likely problem is ,Post-op electrolyte imbalance,Paranoid schizophrenia,Depression psychosis,Delirium tremens,Anoxic brain injury,,4,"Delirium tremens (DT's), is a very serious set of symptoms, may result if alcohol withdrawal is left untreated. Delirium tremens usually does not begin immediately; rather, it appears about 2 to 10 days after the drinking stops. In delirium tremens, the person is initially anxious and later develops increasing confusion, sleeplessness, nightmares, excessive sweating, and profound depression. The pulse rate tends to speed up. Fever typically develops. The episode may escalate to include fleeting hallucinations, illusions that arouse fear and restlessness, and disorientation with visual hallucinations that may incite terror. Objects seen in dim light may be particularly terrifying, and the person becomes extremely confused. The floor may seem to move, the walls fall, or the room rotates. As the delirium progresses, the hands develop a persistent tremor that sometimes extends to the head and body, and most people become severely uncoordinated. Delirium tremens can be fatal, particularly when untreated.He was most likely an alcoholic. This would explain him developing DTs and his need to have a gastrectomy done.",,
508,1,Medicine,"A patient with known type II diabetes mellitus who is treated with Clorpropamide, presents to ER unconscious. His blood sugar is very low. You give the patient 1 ampule of D5 and the patient wakes up promptly. What is the next appropriate management? ",Give another ampule then discharge,Give 2 ampules then discharge,Give another ampule then observe the patient for 6 hours in the ER,"Give one more ampule, admit the patient and start IV glucose infusion with frequent ongoing glucose measurement",,,4,"This patient should be admitted. Hypoglycemia causes sweating, nausea, warmth, anxiety, tremulousness, palpitations, and possibly hunger and paresthesias. Insufficient glucose supply to the brain causes headache, blurred or double vision, confusion, difficulty speaking, seizures, and coma. In controlled settings, autonomic symptoms begin at or beneath a plasma glucose level of about 60 mg/dL (3.33 mmol/L), whereas CNS symptoms occur at or below a glucose level of about 50 mg/dL (2.78 mmol/L).With severe hypoglycemia patients should be given 50% dextrose 50 to 100 mL IV bolus, with or without a continuous infusion of 5 to 10% dextrose solution sufficient to resolve symptoms. Careful monitoring in the inpatient setting is recommended.",,
509,2,OBGYN,"A woman who is 36 weeks pregnant presents with watery vaginal discharge, there is no blood. Mother is afebrile and is not contracting. What is the appropriate next step? ",Do sterile speculum exam,Do an ultrasound,Nonstress test (NST),Give antibiotics to mother,,,1,"Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) may occur at term or earlier (called preterm PROM). Preterm PROM predisposes to preterm delivery. PROM at any time increases risk of infection in the woman (chorioamnionitis), neonate (sepsis), or both; prolapse of the cord; and fetal complications, such as abnormal joint positioning and pulmonary hypoplasia, which may occur with PROM at  24 weeks. Group B streptococci are the most common cause of infection. Unless complications occur, the only symptom is leakage or a sudden gush of fluid from the vagina. Fever, heavy vaginal discharge, abdominal pain, and fetal tachycardia, particularly if out of proportion to maternal temperature, strongly suggest infection.Sterile speculum examination is done to verify PROM, estimate cervical dilation, collect amniotic fluid for culture and fetal maturity tests, and obtain cervical cultures. Digital pelvic examination, particularly multiple examinations, increases risk of infection and is best avoided. Diagnosis is assumed if amniotic fluid appears to be escaping from the cervix or if the fetal vernix or meconium is visible. Other less accurate indicators include vaginal fluid that ferns when dried on a glass slide or turns Nitrazine paper blue (indicating alkalinity, and hence amniotic fluid, normal vaginal fluid is acidic).",,
510,5,Psychiatry,Which of the following is not a symptom of barbiturate withdrawal?,Convulsion,Low pulse,Tremor,Anxiety,,,2,"Barbiturates are prescribed as anticonvulsants, sedatives, and general anesthetics. They can also mimic some of the characteristics of alcohol intoxication (including euphoria, elation, and uninhibited behavior), which make them candidates for abuse. These drugs depress the respiratory and nervous system functions, and because abusers rapidly build up a tolerance to the effects of the drug, fatal overdose or coma can easily occur. Symptoms of withdrawal syndrome appear 12-20 hours after the last dose, they include anxiety, irritability, elevated heart and respiration rate, muscle pain, nausea, tremors, hallucinations, confusion, and seizures. Death is a possibility if the condition is left untreated. Major withdrawal symptoms (convulsions and delirium) may occur within 16 hours and last up to 5 days after abrupt cessation of these drugs.",,
511,2,OBGYN,A G5P5 post-delivery develops a postpartum hemorrhage. What is the most likely cause? ,Vaginal laceration,Chorioamnionitis,Uterine atony,Uterine inversion,,,3,"This patient having five deliveries most likely has uterine atony.Postpartum hemorrhage commonly results from bleeding at the placental implantation site. Risk factors for bleeding at this site include uterine atony due to overdistention caused by multifetal pregnancy, polyhydramnios, or an abnormally large fetus, prolonged or dysfunctional labor, grand multiparity (delivery of  5 viable fetuses), relaxant anesthetics, rapid labor, chorioamnionitis, and retention of placental tissue (eg, due to placenta accreta). Other possible causes of hemorrhagelacerations of the genital tract, extension of an episiotomy, or uterine rupturemust also be considered. Uterine fibroids may contribute. Postpartum hemorrhage due to subinvolution (incomplete involution) of the placental site usually occurs early but may occur as late as 1 month after delivery.",,
512,4,Pediatrics,"A 1 year old child presents with abdominal pain. He is drawing his legs up, bloody mucus in seen in his stool. A sausage shaped mass is palpated in his abdomen. What is the most likely diagnosis? ",Meckels diverticulum,Appendicitis,Pyloric stenosis,Intussusception,,,4,"Intussusception is telescoping of one portion of the intestine (intussusceptum) into an adjacent segment (intussuscipiens), causing intestinal obstruction and sometimes intestinal ischemia. Intussusception generally occurs between ages 3 months and 3 years, with 65% of cases occurring before age 1. It is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in this age group, in whom it is usually idiopathic. In older children, there may be a &ldquo;lead point,&rdquo; ie, a mass or other intestinal abnormality that triggers the telescoping; examples include polyps, lymphoma, Meckel's diverticulum, and Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura. Cystic fibrosis is also a risk factor.The telescoping segments obstruct the intestine and ultimately impair blood flow, causing ischemia, gangrene, and perforation.The initial symptoms are recurrent colicky abdominal pain that occurs every 15 to 20 min, often with vomiting. The child appears relatively well between episodes. Later, as intestinal ischemia develops, pain becomes steady, the child becomes lethargic, and mucosal hemorrhage causes heme-positive stool on rectal examination and sometimes spontaneous passage of a &ldquo;currant jelly&rdquo; (blood mixed with mucus) stool. A palpable abdominal mass, described as sausage-shaped, is sometimes present.",,
513,6,Surgery,A 54 year old man presents with pain in both his lower limbs. On physical exam a weak popliteal artery pulse is noted. What is the appropriate next step? ,Angiogram,Referral to vascular surgeon,Prescribe anticoagulant,X-ray of legs,,q439.jpg,1,"The pulse of the popliteal artery can be palpated behind the knee. A weak pulse may indicate a blockage or thrombosis. Popliteal artery occlusion and the disease occurs by the decreased or complete blockage of the blood supply though the popliteal artery and into the lower leg and foot. Tissue ischemia results. Claudication usually is the first manifestation, followed by rest pain and tissue loss (gangrene). Once a portion of a lower extremity becomes gangrenous, infection becomes a constant mortal threat.Angiography is the criterion standard evaluation for identifying popliteal occlusion. It also allows visualization of possible targets for distal bypass.",,
514,6,Surgery,A man who is a competitive runner has pain when walking. It has increased and is noted in his 2nd and 3rd metatarsal bone of his forefoot. What is the most likely diagnosis? ,Osgood-Schlatter,Stress fracture,Sesamoid bone fracture,Plantar fasciitis,,,2,"Metatarsal stress fractures involve the metatarsal shafts and are caused by repetitive weight-bearing stress. Stress fractures do not result from a discrete injury (eg, fall, blow) but occur after repeated stress. Metatarsal stress fractures (march fractures) usually occur in runners and in poorly conditioned patients who walk long distances carrying a load (eg, new recruit soldiers); they most commonly occur in the 2nd metatarsal. Risk factors include a cavus foot (high arch), shoes with inadequate shock-absorbing qualities, and osteoporosis; these fractures also may be a sign of the female athlete triad (amenorrhea, eating disorder, and osteoporosis).Forefoot pain that occurs after a long or intense workout, then disappears shortly after stopping exercise is the typical initial presentation. With subsequent exercise, onset of pain is progressively earlier, and pain may become so severe that it prohibits exercise and persists even when the patient is not bearing weight.",,
515,6,Surgery,A 68 year old man is going for an elective surgery. He has a 4 month history of chest pain and develops a similar episode of chest pain the night before the day of surgery. What is the appropriate action? ,Lidocaine before surgery,Nitroglycerin during surgery,Cancel surgery and transfer to the ICU immediately,Postpone the operation and do a stress test,,,4,"Before an elective surgery most patients will have labs and tests done to determine if the patient is suitable and safe candidate for the surgery. Typical tests include CBC, CMP, EKG, Chest x-rays and urinalysis. Chest pain in an elderly individual warrants further pre-op testing, most appropriately with a cardiac stress test.A cardiac stress test is a medical test performed to evaluate arterial blood flow to (and indirectly the amount of oxygen that will reach) the myocardium (heart muscle) during physical exercise, compared to blood flow while at rest.",,
516,2,OBGYN,A 20 year old college student presents with lower abdominal pain and fever. Physical exam shows bilateral lower abdominal tenderness.

What is the most likely diagnosis? ,Acute salpingitis,Ectopic pregnancy,UTI,Trichomonas,,,1,"Pelvic inflammatory disease is infection of the upper female genital tract: the cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries; abscesses may occur. Common symptoms and signs include lower abdominal pain, cervical discharge, and irregular vaginal bleeding. Long-term complications include infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and ectopic pregnancy.Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) results from microorganisms ascending from the vagina and cervix into the endometrium and fallopian tubes. Infection of the cervix (cervicitis) causes mucopurulent discharge. Infection of the fallopian tubes (salpingitis) and uterus (endometritis) tend to occur together. If severe, infection can spread to the ovaries (oophoritis) and then the peritoneum (peritonitis). These infections are called salpingitis even though they involve other structures.Diagnosis includes PCR of cervical specimens for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and chlamydiae, microscopic examination of cervical discharge (usually), and ultrasonography or laparoscopy (occasionally). Treatment is with antibiotics.",,
517,2,OBGYN,A woman presents with vaginal bleeding. Her pregnancy test is positive. However an ultrasound shows an empty uterus and left adnexal mass. What is the most likely diagnosis? ,Acute salpingitis,Ectopic pregnancy,UTI,Trichomonas,,,2,"In ectopic pregnancy, implantation occurs in a site other than the endometrial lining of the uterine cavityin the fallopian tube, uterine interstitium, cervix, ovary, or abdominal or pelvic cavity. Ectopic pregnancies cannot be carried to term and eventually rupture or involute. Early symptoms and signs include pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, and cervical motion tenderness. Syncope or hemorrhagic shock can occur with rupture. Diagnosis is by -human chorionic gonadotropin measurement and ultrasonography. Absence of an intrauterine sac with a -hCG level  2000 mIU/mL strongly suggests an ectopic pregnancy Treatment is with laparoscopic or open surgical resection or with IM methotrexate.",,

The cause is unknown. Diagnosis is based on history. Treatment consists of psychotherapy, drug therapy, or, especially in severe cases, both. Many experts believe that combining psychotherapy and drug therapy is best, especially for severe cases. Medications used are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg fluoxetine) and clomipramine.Neurosurgical treatment of OCD is performed at a limited number of centers and is reserved for patients with severe and refractory symptoms. The most common small series use a specific small lesion (eg, cingulotomy) or deep brain stimulation. ",,

",Hives,Hereditary angioedema,Normal allergic response,Immunodeficiency,,,2,"Hereditary angioedema is caused by deficiency (type 1; in 85%) or dysfunction (type 2; in 15%) of C1 inhibitor, a protein that regulates the classical complement activation pathway. Inheritance is autosomal dominant. C1 inhibitor deficiency may also develop when complement is consumed in neoplastic disorders or when C1 inhibitor autoantibody is produced in monoclonal gammopathy (acquired deficiency). Attacks are precipitated by trauma or viral illness and aggravated by emotional stress.Symptoms and signs are similar to those of angioedema except that edema progresses until complement components have been consumed; the GI tract is often involved, causing nausea, vomiting, colic, and signs of intestinal obstruction.Diagnosis is by detection of low levels C1 inhibitor.

The typical presentation of a thrombosed external hemorrhoid is an acute onset of very severe perianal pain, particularly when walking and sitting. You know that it is an external hemorrhoid because it is below the dentate line.Acutely thrombosed external hemorrhoids may be safely excised in the emergency department in patients who present within 48-72 hours of symptom onset. In patients presenting after 72 hours from the start of symptoms, conservative medical therapy is preferable. ",,
536,4,Pediatrics,A child has juvenile polyposis. What possible complication is likely in this patient?,Diarrhea,Painless bleeding,Painful bleeding,Malignancy,,,2,"The most common symptom is painless rectal bleeding. Other warning signs include polyps protruding in the rectum; slipping of one part of the intestine into another; or malnutrition. A juvenile polyp is a growth that projects from the lining of the intestine and originates in the tissues supporting that lining. It does not arise from the colonocytes (colonic lining cells) themselves but from the tissues underneath the lining cells. It is not neoplastic but hamartomatous. A hamartoma is a growth that arises from normal tissues. It is self-limiting and benign. Juvenile polyps can be solitary or multiple. Juvenile polyps occur in children, they typically outgrow their blood supply and autoamputate some time during or after puberty. Treatment is required only for uncontrollable bleeding or intussusception.",,

",Vaginal culture,Ultrasound and voiding cystography,Blood culture,Abdominal X-ray,"Serum LH, FSH and prolactin levels",,2,"Recurrent UTIs are sometimes seen in conjunction with conditions, such as: vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) and hydronephrosis.VUR which is found in 30% to 50% of children diagnosed with a UTI and is a congenital condition in which urine flows backward from the bladder to the ureters and sometimes reaches the kidneys. If the urine in the bladder is infected with bacteria, VUR can lead to pyelonephritis. Hydronephrosis, which is an enlargement of one or both kidneys due to backup or blockage of urine flow and is usually caused by severe VUR or a blocked ureter. Children with hydronephrosis are sometimes at risk of recurrent UTIs and may need to take daily low doses of antibiotics to prevent UTIs. Diagnostic workup should include ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram.",,
538,1,Medicine,"Regarding fibroadenoma of the breast, all of the following are true, except:  ",The most common benign tumor,When aspirated - no fluid comes out,Malignant tumor,Tumor is encapsulated,Tumor is mobile,,3,"Fibroadenoma is the most common benign tumor of the breast and the most common breast tumor in women under age 30. They are typically painless lumps that feel like small, slippery marbles. They usually develop in young women, often in teenagers, and may be mistaken for cancer although they are benign and tend to be more circumscribed and mobile. Simple fibroadenoma does not appear to increase risk of breast cancer; complex fibroadenoma may increase risk slightly.The tumor is not fixed to the adjacent skin, muscle, or lymph nodes, so they are mobile within the breast on palpation. It is commonly found immediately adjacent to the areola, though rarely directly behind the nipple. Macroscopically the tumor is round or ovoid, elastic, nodular, and has a well demarcated capsule; on cut surface it is grey-white. When aspirated - no fluid comes out.",,

What is the most likely etiology? ,Dermatomyositis,Multiple sclerosis,Carpal tunnel syndrome,Hyperventilation syndrome,Wrist fracture,,3,"Carpal tunnel syndrome is compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist. Symptoms include pain and paresthesias in the median nerve distribution. Diagnosis is suggested by symptoms and signs and confirmed by nerve conduction velocity testing. Treatments include ergonomic improvements, analgesia, splinting, and sometimes corticosteroid injection or surgery. Carpal tunnel syndrome is very common and most often occurs in women aged 30 to 50. Risk factors include RA or other wrist arthritis (sometimes the presenting manifestation), diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, acromegaly, amyloidosis, and pregnancy-induced edema in the carpal tunnel. Activities or jobs that require repetitive flexion and extension of the wrist may contribute. Most cases are idiopathic.",,

",Rectocele,Cystocele,Prolapse (Procidentia),Urethral sphincter spasm,Post-surgical stricture,,2,"A cystocele occurs when the wall between a woman's bladder and vagina weakens and stretches, allowing the bladder to bulge into the vagina. A cystocele may also be called a prolapsed bladder. A cystocele may occur from excessive straining, such as during childbirth, chronic constipation or heavy lifting. It may also occur after menopause, when estrogen decreases. Therefore, older women and those who have given birth to several children are more likely to develop a cystocele. For mild and moderate cystoceles, self-care measures or nonsurgical treatments are often effective. In more severe cases of cystocele, surgery may be necessary to keep the vagina and other pelvic organs in their proper positions. In mild cases, it's possible to not even notice a bulge. When cystocele symptoms do present themselves, they may include a feeling of fullness or pressure in your pelvis and vagina, especially when standing for long periods of time. Increased discomfort when you strain, cough, bear down or lift. A bulge of tissue that, in severe cases, protrudes through your vaginal opening.",,

Which of the following is the appropriate management?,Debridement and skin graft,Debridement and bandage,Debridement and topical antibiotics,Clean the wound and systemic antibiotic,Local care only,,3,"First-degree burns are the most shallow (superficial). They affect only the top layer of skin (epidermis). Second-degree burns extend into the middle layer of skin (dermis). Third-degree burns involve all three layers of skin (epidermis, dermis, and fat layer), usually destroying the sweat glands, hair follicles, and nerve endings as well.As with more superficial burns, deep minor burns are treated with antibiotic cream. However, any dead skin and broken blisters must be removed before the antibiotic cream is applied. In addition, keeping a deeply burned arm or leg elevated above the heart for the first few days reduces swelling and pain. The burn may require frequent re-examination at a hospital or doctor's office, possibly as often as daily for the first few days.",,

Because of the serious risk to the public of a rabid animal on the loose, it is important to document the conditions surrounding the attack. As a result of widespread vaccination of dogs against rabies, the most common source of the rabies virus is now wild animals, specifically raccoons, skunks and bats.Nonetheless, there are still reported cases of rabies virus associated with a dog bite. Patients with a bite from a nonprovoked dog should be considered at higher risk for rabies infection than patients with a bite from a provoked dog. If the dog owner is reliable and can confirm that the animal's vaccination against rabies virus is current, the dog may be observed at the owner's home. Observation by a veterinarian is appropriate when the vaccination status of the animal is unknown. If the animal cannot be quarantined for 10 days, the dog bite victim should receive rabies immunization.",,

Symptoms include irritation and bleeding. Thrombosed hemorrhoids are painful. Diagnosis is by inspection or anoscopy. Treatment is symptomatic or with endoscopic banding, injection sclerotherapy, or sometimes surgery. External hemorrhoids may become thrombosed, resulting in a painful, purplish swelling. Rarely, they ulcerate and cause minor bleeding. Cleansing the anal region may be difficult.Internal hemorrhoids typically present with bleeding following defecation; blood is noted on toilet tissue and sometimes in the toilet bowl. Internal hemorrhoids may be uncomfortable but are not as painful as thrombosed external hemorrhoids. Internal hemorrhoids sometimes cause mucus discharge and a sensation of incomplete evacuation.Strangulated hemorrhoids occur when protrusion and constriction occlude the blood supply. They cause pain that is occasionally followed by necrosis and ulceration.",,
552,2,OBGYN,Which of the following is safe to give to a pregnant women with deep venous thrombosis (DVT)?  ,Warfarin,Heparin,Antistreptokinase,Alteplase,,,2,A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that forms in a deep vein. Veins are blood vessels that take blood towards the heart. Deep veins in the leg run through the muscles of the calf and thighs. The most common sites for a DVT during pregnancy and after birth are in a vein in the leg (especially the calf or thigh) or in the pelvis (lower part of abdomen). Treatment is with an injection of heparin. This medication is said to &lsquo;thin the blood' (an anti-coagulant). There are different types of heparin. The type that is commonly chosen in pregnancy is &lsquo;low molecular weight heparin' (LMWH). Heparin is safe to give during pregnancy because it does not cross the placenta.,,

The most likely diagnosis is ",Psychosis,Depression,Post-op delirium,Analgesic withdrawal syndrome,,,3,"Delirium is an acute, transient, usually reversible, fluctuating disturbance in attention, cognition, and consciousness level.Causes include almost any disorder, intoxication, or drug. Recent exposure to anesthesia also increases risk, especially if exposure is prolonged and if anticholinergics are given during surgery.Delirium is characterized primarily by difficulty focusing, maintaining, or shifting attention (inattention). Consciousness level fluctuates; patients are disoriented to time and sometimes place or person. They may have hallucinations. Confusion regarding day-to-day events and daily routines is common, as are changes in personality and affect. Symptoms may include inappropriate behavior, fearfulness, and paranoia. Patients may become irritable, agitated, hyperactive, and hyperalert, or they may become quiet, withdrawn, and lethargic. Diagnosis is clinical, with laboratory and usually imaging tests to identify the cause. Treatment is correction of the cause and supportive measures.",,
554,6,Surgery,A 26 year old man consults you for testicular discomfort and heaviness. He states he noticed this left testicle has slightly enlarged. Transillumination is done and is negative. What is the most likely diagnosis? ,Spermatocele,Epididymitis,Varicocele,Hydrocele,Seminoma,,3,"A varicocele is defined as dilated and tortuous veins within the pampiniform plexus of scrotal veins. It is the most surgically correctable cause of male subfertility. The varicocele is a disease of puberty and is only rarely detected in boys &lt;10 years of age. A left-sided varicocele is found in 15% of healthy young men. In contrast, the incidence of a left varicocele in subfertile men approaches 40%. Bilateral varicoceles are uncommon in healthy men (&lt;10%) but are palpated in up to 20% of subfertile men. In general, varicoceles do not spontaneously regress. The cornerstone of varicocele diagnosis rests on an accurate physical examination. Varicoceles are associated with testicular atrophy and varicocele correction can reverse atrophy in adolescents.During the transillumination test, a flashlight is shone through the enlarged portion of the scrotum. If a hydrocele is present (fluid build-up around the testicle(s)), the scrotum will light up and the test will be positive. If it is a varicocele it will not light up.Note: Spermatocele and Hydrocele have positive transillumination test; Epididymitis is painful; Seminoma is unlikely to be this patient's diagnosis (it usually presents with a painless testicular lump); ",,
555,1,Medicine,A 47 year old female presents with sudden strong pain in her right upper quadrant. She has a fever of 38.5 degrees and she is vomiting. She is not jaundiced. What is the most likely diagnosis? ,Cancer of pancreas,Acute cholecystitis,Acute hepatitis,Biliary lithiasis,,,2,"Acute cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder that develops over hours, usually as a result of cystic duct obstruction by a gallstone. Symptoms include right upper quadrant pain and tenderness, sometimes accompanied by fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting. Most patients have had prior attacks of biliary colic or acute cholecystitis. The pain of cholecystitis has a quality and location similar to that of biliary colic but with longer duration (ie, &gt; 6 hours) and greater severity. Vomiting is common, as is right subcostal tenderness. Within a few hours, Murphy's sign (deep inspiration exacerbates the pain during palpation of the right upper quadrant and halts inspiration) develops with involuntary guarding of right-sided abdominal muscles. Fever, usually low grade, is common. In the elderly, fever may not develop, and the first or only symptoms may be systemic and nonspecific (eg, anorexia, vomiting, malaise, weakness, fever).Abdominal ultrasound detects the gallstone and sometimes the associated inflammation. Treatment usually involves antibiotics and cholecystectomy.",,

",Purulent meningitis,Ethmoidal sinusitis,Orbital cellulitis,Frontal sinusitis,,q482.jpg,3,"Orbital cellulitis (postseptal cellulitis) is infection of the orbital tissues posterior to the orbital septum. Either can be caused by an external focus of infection (eg, a wound), infection that extends from the nasal sinuses or teeth, or metastatic spread from infection elsewhere. Orbital cellulitis is most often caused by extension of infection from adjacent sinuses (ethmoid, maxillary), it is less commonly caused by direct infection accompanying local trauma (eg, insect or animal bite, penetrating eyelid injuries) or contiguous spread of infection from the face.Symptoms include eyelid pain, discoloration, and swelling. Orbital cellulitis also causes fever, malaise, exophthalmos, impaired eye mobility, and impaired vision. Diagnosis is based on history, examination, and neuroimaging. Treatment is with antibiotics and sometimes surgical drainage.",,
557,4,Pediatrics,A 3 year old female patient presents with a painless mobile mass in her right upper quadrant without fever or jaundice. What is the most likely diagnosis? ,Tumor of left inferior lobe of the liver,Choledochal cyst,Tumor of superior pole of the right kidney,Liver metastasis,,,2,"In a choledochal cyst the common bile duct of the biliary tree is structurally abnormal, probably from the time of birth. Usually by the age of 2 or 3 years the bile begins to collect in the duct. It forms a sack or cyst which then presses on the bile duct and may prevent bile from reaching the intestine. Bile can back up into the liver and the patient becomes jaundiced. The classic symptoms of abdominal mass, pain and jaundice is rarely seen during childhood. Some children may not show symptoms for years. In some patients, the cyst can be felt by the physical examining the abdomen. Blood studies such as a serum amylase and liver function tests may be drawn during acute episodes of pain. Abdominal ultrasonography is the test of choice for the diagnosis of a choledochal cyst. Abdominal CT scan and MRI help to delineate the anatomy of the lesion and the surrounding structures. These tests also can assist in defining the presence and extent of intrahepatic ductal involvement.The treatment of choice for choledochal cysts is complete excision of the cyst with construction of a biliary-enteric anastomosis to restore continuity with the gastrointestinal tract.",,
558,4,Pediatrics,A 13 year old obese child presents with painful right knee and right hip pain with difficulty walking and reduced abduction and internal rotation. What is your diagnosis? ,Juvenile arthritis,Septic arthritis of the hip,Avascular necrosis of femoral head,Cartilage dysplasia,Slipped capital femoral epiphysis,,5,"Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) usually occurs in early adolescence and preferentially affects boys. Obesity is a significant risk factor. Exact cause is unknown but probably relates to weakening of the physis (growth plate), which can result from trauma, hormonal changes, inflammation, or increased shearing forces due to obesity.Onset is usually insidious, and symptoms are associated with stage of slippage. The 1st symptom may be hip stiffness that abates with rest; it is followed by a limp, then hip pain that radiates down the anteromedial thigh to the knee. Early hip examination may detect neither pain nor limitation of movement. In more advanced stages, findings may include pain during movement of the affected hip, with limited flexion, abduction, and medial rotation; knee pain without specific knee abnormalities; and a limp. The affected leg is externally rotated. Because treatment of advanced slippage is difficult, early diagnosis is vital. Anteroposterior and frog-leg lateral x-rays of both hips are taken. X-rays show widening of the epiphyseal line or apparent posterior and inferior displacement of the femoral head. Ultrasonography and MRI are also useful, especially if x-rays are normal.SCFE usually progresses; it requires surgery as soon as it is diagnosed. Patients should not bear weight on the affected leg until SCFE has been ruled out or treated. Surgical treatment consists of screw fixation through the epiphysis.",,
559,1,Medicine,A 65 year old obese male patient complains of strong and sudden mid abdominal pain radiating to his left flank. Physical exam does not show any findings. What is the most likely diagnosis? ,Acute pancreatitis,Cholecystitis,Ureteral stone,Mesenteric ischemia,Rupture of abdominal aorta,,4,"Acute mesenteric ischemia is interruption of intestinal blood flow by embolism, thrombosis, or a low-flow state. It leads to mediator release, inflammation, and ultimately infarction. Abdominal pain is out of proportion to physical findings. The early hallmark of mesenteric ischemia is severe pain but minimal physical findings. The abdomen remains soft, with little or no tenderness. Mild tachycardia may be present. Early diagnosis is difficult, but angiography and exploratory laparotomy have the most sensitivity; other imaging modalities often become positive only late in the disease. Treatment is by embolectomy, revascularization of viable segments, or resection; sometimes vasodilator therapy is successful. Mortality is high.",,

",Biopsy,Barium study,Peritoneal Aspiration,Rectosigmoidoscopy,Ultrasound,,5,"Cholelithiasis is the presence of one or more calculi (gallstones) in the gallbladder. 20% of people  65 years have gallstones, and most disorders of the extrahepatic biliary tract arise from gallstones. Gallstones may be asymptomatic or cause biliary colic.Pain may occur in the right upper quadrant but is often poorly localized or occurs elsewhere in the abdomen, particularly among diabetics and the elderly. Mild right upper quadrant or epigastric tenderness may be present, but peritoneal findings are absent, and laboratory tests are normal. Diagnosis is usually based on ultrasound. If cholelithiasis causes symptoms or complications, cholecystectomy becomes necessary.",,
561,2,OBGYN,The most common complication of epidural anesthesia in a pregnant woman is: ,Fetal hypoxia,Maternal hypotension,Decrease in contractions,Arrest of labor,,,2,"Significant low blood pressure is a complication of epidural anesthesia. The ways that epiduralized patients must lie accentuate this. Their position is limited since they are essentially paralyzed people for the duration of the epidural. Hypotension occurs among almost one-third of patients with serious hypotension occurring about 12% of the time.Maternal hypotension is a major risk for the baby. The epidural blocks the nerves which regulate blood pressure. It causes the blood in the body to pool, keeping it from being pumped around the body in the proper manner. The arteries dilate and relax their usual, necessary level of tension, making it difficult for the heart to pump blood to the baby. These changes lead to a decrease in the output of the mothers heart. Less blood per unit time can reach the placenta and therefore the baby.The baby is completely dependent on the mothers heart to pump blood to the placenta to satisfy its needs. All of its oxygen comes across from the placenta. All of the food for its brain and other organs comes across the placenta. Brains cannot live without a relatively constant supply of oxygen and glucose. Without this they become damaged.",,
562,4,Pediatrics,"A child that is pulled up by his mother by the arms, develops pain and starts crying. He is brought into the ER.

",Humeral fracture,Laxation of the inferior extremity of the ulna,Subluxation of radial head,Rupture of rotator cuff,,q488.jpg,3,"This is a case of radial head subluxations (nursemaid's elbow). In toddlers (about 2 to 3 years old), the radial head is no wider than the radial neck and can easily slip through these ligaments (radial head subluxation). Subluxation results from traction on the forearm as when a caregiver pulls a reluctant toddler forward or catches the toddler by the wrist during a fall&mdash;actions many caregivers do not remember. Symptoms may include pain and tenderness; however, many toddlers cannot describe their symptoms and simply avoid moving the affected elbow (pseudoparalysis).Plain x-rays are normal and considered unnecessary by some experts unless an alternate diagnosis is clinically suspected. Reduction may be diagnostic and therapeutic. The elbow is completely extended and supinated, then flexed, usually without sedation or analgesia. Reduction is often marked by a subtle palpable pop or click as the radial head resumes normal position. Children may start to move the elbow after about 20 min. Immobilization is unnecessary. If pain or dysfunction lasts longer than 24 hours, incomplete reduction or an occult fracture should be suspected.",,

What is the most appropriate initial treatment? ,Furosemide,Metoprolol,Morphine,Enalapril,,,1,"Sometimes increased pressure in the blood vessels in the lungs forces fluid into the air sacs, preventing them from absorbing oxygen, a condition called pulmonary edema.The treatment of pulmonary edema is as follows:Preload reducers. Diuretics, such as furosemide (Lasix) are used to treat pulmonary edema. These medications dilate the veins in the lungs and elsewhere in the body, which decreases fluid pressure going into the heart and lungs.Morphine, a narcotic, is a mainstay in treating cardiac pulmonary edema, may be used to relieve shortness of breath and associated anxiety. Afterload reducers. These drugs dilate the peripheral vessels and take a pressure load off the left ventricle. Some examples of afterload reducer medications include nitroprusside and enalapril.",,

Physical exam shows hepatomegaly and abdominal tenderness. Labs reveal her SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT) are greatly increased, alkaline phosphatase is slightly increased. What is the most likely diagnosis? ",Drug induced hepatitis,Viral hepatitis,Acute pancreatitis,Liver cancer,,,1,"INH stands for isoniazid. But INH could also stand for &lsquo;Injures Neurons and Hepatocytes'. Because of the risk of hepatitis, patients taking INH should have their blood liver tests monitored monthly and should notify their physicians immediately if symptoms or signs of hepatitis arise. These symptoms and signs include unexplained loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, yellow skin or a yellowish tinge to the whites of the eyes, persistent fatigue, weakness or fever of greater than 3 days duration, or abdominal tenderness or discomfort, especially in the right upper part of the abdomen. Damage to nerves (peripheral neuropathy) may occur with INH and cause numbness and tingling of the hands or feet. Other rare side effects of the nervous system include encephalopathy (inflammation of the brain), optic neuritis (inflammation of the nerve coming from the eye), atrophy (degeneration) of the nerve coming from the eye, seizures, impaired memory, psychosis.

What is the most specific test to confirm this? ,Increased fibrin degradation products,CBC,PT and INR,PTT,,,1,"Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) involves abnormal, excessive generation of thrombin and fibrin in the circulating blood. During the process, increased platelet aggregation and coagulation factor consumption occur. DIC that evolves slowly (over weeks or months) causes primarily venous thrombotic and embolic manifestations; DIC that evolves rapidly (over hours or days) causes primarily bleeding. Severe, rapidly evolving DIC is diagnosed by demonstrating thrombocytopenia, an elevated PTT and PT, increased levels of serum fibrin degradation products, and a decreasing plasma fibrinogen level. Treatment includes correction of the underlying cause and replacement of platelets, coagulation factors (in fresh frozen plasma), and fibrinogen (in cryoprecipitate) to control severe bleeding. Heparin is used as therapy (or prophylaxis) in patients with slowly evolving DIC who have (or are at risk for) venous thromboembolism.",,

All of the following suggest non- organic cause, except",Does not worry about weight loss,Engaged in athletic activity,Family history of eating disorder,Persistent complain of fatigue,,,4,"An organic cause of weight loss would be related to an organ in the body. The most common cause of non-organic (psychiatric) weight loss is anorexia nervosa.Anorexia nervosa is characterized by a relentless pursuit of thinness, a morbid fear of obesity, a refusal to maintain a minimally normal body weight, and, in women, amenorrhea. Anorexia is a misnomer, because appetite remains until the patient becomes cachectic. Patients are preoccupied with food: They study diets and calories; hoard, conceal, and waste food; collect recipes; and prepare elaborate meals for others. Patients are often manipulative, lying about food intake and concealing behavior, such as induced vomiting. Binge eating followed by induced vomiting and the use of laxatives and diuretics occurs in 50%. The others simply restrict their food intake. Most anorectics exercise excessively to control weight.Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment is with cognitive-behavioral therapy; olanzapine may help with weight gain, and SSRIs, especially fluoxetine, may help prevent relapse. Anorexia nervosa may be mild and transient or severe and long-standing. Most patients are lean yet are concerned about body weight and restrict food intake. Preoccupation and anxiety about weight increase, even as emaciation develops.",,

To parents, the stuttering may be upsetting and frustrating, but it is natural for kids to do some stuttering at this stage of development. A child may stutter for a few weeks or several months, and the stuttering may be sporadic. For most kids who begin stuttering before the age of 5, the stuttering eventually goes away without any need for intervention such as speech or language therapy. However, if the child's stuttering is frequent, continues to get worse, and is accompanied by body or facial movements, it's a good idea for a speech-language therapist to evaluate your child before he or she is 3 years old.",,

Symptoms usually include diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. Celiac sprue is a hereditary disorder caused by sensitivity to the gliadin fraction of gluten, a protein found in wheat; similar proteins occur in rye and barley. The inflammatory response produces characteristic mucosal villous atrophy in the small bowel.In adults, lassitude, weakness, and anorexia are most common. Mild and intermittent diarrhea is sometimes the presenting symptom. Steatorrhea ranges from mild to severe (7 to 50 g fat/day). Some patients have weight loss, rarely enough to become underweight. Anemia, glossitis, angular stomatitis, and aphthous ulcers are usually seen in these patients. About 10% have dermatitis herpetiformis, an intensely pruritic papulovesicular rash that is symmetrically distributed over the extensor areas of the elbows, knees, buttocks, shoulders, and scalp. This rash can be induced by a high-gluten diet.

Signs and symptoms include feeding intolerance, lethargy, temperature instability, ileus, bloating, bilious emesis, hematochezia, reducing substances in the stool, apnea, and sometimes signs of sepsis. Diagnosis is clinical and is confirmed by imaging studies. Screening the stools of enterally fed premature infants for occult blood or reducing substances may help diagnose NEC early. Early x-rays may be nonspecific and reveal only ileus. However, a fixed, dilated intestinal loop that does not change on repeated x-rays indicates NEC. X-ray signs diagnostic of NEC are pneumatosis intestinalis and portal vein gas. Pneumoperitoneum indicates bowel perforation and an urgent need for surgery.Treatment is primarily supportive and includes nasogastric suction, parenteral fluids, TPN, antibiotics, isolation in cases of infection, and, often, surgery.",,

The primary symptom is pruritus. Skin changes range from erythema to blistering and ulceration, often on or near the hands but occurring on any exposed skin surface. Diagnosis is by exposure history, examination, and sometimes skin patch testing. Treatment entails antipruritics, topical corticosteroids, and avoidance of causes. Topical treatment includes cool compresses (saline or Burow's) and corticosteroids; patients with mild to moderate cases are given mid-potency topical corticosteroids (eg, triamcinolone 0.1% ointment or betamethasone valerate cream 0.1%). Oral corticosteroids (eg, prednisone 60 mg once/day for 7 to 14 days) can be used for severe blistering or extensive disease.",,
610,1,Medicine,The best initial test for hyperaldosteronism (conn disease) in a patient who you suspect to have a secondary cause of hypertension is: ,Serum renin level,Basic metabolic panel,Serum aldosterone level,CT of abdomen,,,2,"Hyperaldosteronism can be caused by a tumor (usually a noncancerous adenoma) in the adrenal gland (a condition called Conn's syndrome), although sometimes both glands are involved and are overactive. Sometimes hyperaldosteronism is a response to certain diseases, such as very high blood pressure (hypertension) or narrowing of one of the arteries to the kidneys.A doctor who suspects hyperaldosteronism first tests the levels of sodium and potassium in the blood by obtaining a basic metabolic panel (BMP). The doctor may also measure aldosterone levels. If they are high, spironolactone, a drug that blocks the action of aldosterone, may be given to see if the levels of sodium and potassium return to normal. In Conn's syndrome, the levels of renin are also very low.When too much aldosterone is being produced, doctors examine the adrenal glands for a noncancerous tumor (adenoma). Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be helpful.",,

",Antisocial,Borderline,Histrionic,Narcissistic,,,1,"Antisocial personality is marked by the callous disregard for the rights and feelings of other people. Affected people exploit others for materialistic gain or personal gratification. They become frustrated easily and tolerate frustration poorly. Characteristically, they act out their conflicts impulsively and irresponsibly, sometimes with hostility and violence. They usually do not anticipate the consequences of their behaviors and typically do not feel remorse or guilt afterward. Many of them have a well-developed capacity for rationalizing their behavior or blaming it on others. Dishonesty and deceit permeate their relationships. Punishment rarely modifies their behavior or improves their judgment. Antisocial personality often leads to alcoholism, drug addiction, promiscuity, failure to fulfill responsibilities, frequent relocation, and difficulty abiding by laws. Life expectancy is decreased, but the disorder tends to diminish or stabilize with aging.",,

Patients typically describe binge-purge behavior. Binges involve rapid consumption of food, especially high-calorie foods, such as ice cream and cake. Binges vary in amount of food consumed, sometimes involving thousands of calories. They tend to be episodic, are often triggered by psychosocial stress, may occur as often as several times a day, and are carried out in secret.Most symptoms and physical complications result from purging.

Cushing's disease is Cushing's syndrome that results from excess pituitary production of ACTH, usually secondary to a pituitary adenoma. Typical symptoms include moon facies and truncal obesity with thin arms and legs. Diagnosis is by history of receiving corticosteroids or by elevated serum cortisol. Diagnosis is confirmed with the dexamethasone test, in which 1, 1.5, or 2 mg of dexamethasone is administered po at 11 to 12 pm and plasma cortisol is measured at 8 to 9 am the next morning. In most normal patients, this drug suppresses morning plasma cortisol to &le; 1.8 &mu;g/mL (&le; 50 nmol/L), whereas patients with Cushing's syndrome virtually always have a higher level. A more specific but equally sensitive test is to give dexamethasone 0.5 mg po q 6 h for 2 days (low dose). In general, a clear failure to suppress levels in response to low-dose dexamethasone establishes the diagnosis.",,
624,1,Medicine,"On her annual physical exam, a young white patient, known for refractory hypertension is found to have right flank continuous bruit. You suspect a secondary cause for her hypertension. Which of the following is most likely? ",Hyperaldosteronism,Cushing syndrome,Renal artery stenosis,Aortic coarctation,Pheochromocytoma,,3,"Renovascular hypertension (RVH) is the most common form of curable high blood pressure and is estimated to affect 1% of all hypertensive individuals. It occurs when significant unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis causes renal ischemia.RVH develops as a result of significant stenosis (generally 60%) of one main renal artery and occasionally arises from lesions of a distal branch. Two thirds of renal artery stenoses result from atherosclerosis, whereas the various forms of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) are responsible for approximately one third. Atherosclerotic lesions are typically proximal and found more frequently in older men with evidence of extensive vascular involvement. Bilateral disease, azotemia, and recurrent pulmonary edema are also more frequent in this group. Conversely, patients with FMD tend to be young white women with no family history of essential hypertension; lesions usually involve the middle and distal segments of the renal artery. Smoking increases the risk of renovascular hypertension in both groups. Physical examination may show abdominal or flank continuous bruit and/or advanced retinopathy (grades III, IV by KWB classification)",,

What is the best type of analgesia to give for her pain? ,Codeine,NSAID,Aspirin,Morphine,,,4,"The immediate pain that follows a burn injury is due to the stimulation of skin nociceptors (pain sensing nerves). Nerve endings that are completely destroyed will not transmit pain, but those that remain intact will trigger pain throughout the time and course of treatment, as will regenerating nerves - those still connected with intact afferent fibres. Intravenous medications, especially IV opioids such as morphine, are well suited to fulfill analgesic requirements.",,

Motor vehicle crashes, sporting injuries, falls, and assault account for the majority, although injuries from gunshot wounds and stabbings occur as well. Always be concerned about other injuries with facial fractures. In particular, other parts of the body may be injured, for example, if a patient has facial injuries in a motor vehicle accident.In a midface (maxillary) fracture symptoms include inability to bring the teeth together properly, visual problems and clear nasal discharge. Bruising may be present around the eyes and the midface may be able to be moved.These fractures are not usually subtle and are often the result of high-speed car accidents. As a result, there might be severe injury to areas other than the face.",,

Symptoms include unilateral hearing loss. Slowly progressive unilateral sensorineural hearing loss is the hallmark symptom.In the Weber test a tuning fork is struck and the stem of the fork is placed on the top of the patient's skull - equal distance from the patient's ears, in the middle of the forehead. The patient is asked to report in which ear the sound is heard louder.A patient with a unilateral sensorineural hearing loss would hear the sound loudest in the unaffected ear.A patient with a unilateral conductive hearing loss would hear the tuning fork loudest in the affected ear.The Rinne test is performed by placing a vibrating tuning fork initially on the mastoid process (behind the ear) until sound is no longer heard, the fork is then immediately placed just outside the ear. Normally, the sound is audible at the ear.In a normal ear, air conduction (AC) is better than bone conduction (BC). AC &gt; BC, and this is called a positive Rinne. In conductive hearing loss, bone conduction is better than air: BC &gt; AC, a negative Rinne. In sensorineural hearing loss, bone conduction and air conduction are both equally depreciated, maintaining the relative difference of: AC &gt; BC, a positive Rinne.",,

Which of the following is the least appropriate management? ,Cesarean section,Spontaneous breech birth,Partial breech extraction,Total breech extraction,,,1,"Under such unusual circumstances, when a second twin is breech or a breech vaginal birth is progressing quickly, a cesarean is neither recommended nor possible. There are several different types of vaginal breech deliveries:The delivery can occur without help from a health professional (spontaneous breech birth). During a spontaneous breech birth, the fetus comes out of the vagina without problems. The health professional just supports the fetus's body as it emerges from the birth canal.A health professional may need to help deliver the upper part of the fetus's body (partial breech extraction). During a partial breech extraction, a health professional pulls gently downward on the fetus and rotates its body as needed to deliver the shoulders, arms, and head.Occasionally, a health professional may need to help the fetus during the entire delivery (total breech extraction). This is usually done only when the fetus is having problems and needs to be delivered as quickly as possible.During a partial or total breech extraction, the health professional may need to reach into the birth canal in order to move part of the fetus into a better position for delivery. If the health professional is having difficulty delivering the fetus's head, forceps may be used to guide the head through the birth canal. Forceps may also be used to speed delivery if the fetus is in danger.",,
632,2,OBGYN,A pregnant woman presents in labor at 39 weeks gestation. Her fetus is at zero station and she is dilated 10 cm. She also is noticed to have a bulging membrane. What is the most appropriate management? ,Cesarean,Oxytocin,Tocolysis,Amniotomy,,,4,"The 1st stage, from onset of labor to full dilation of the cervix (about 10 cm), has 2 phases, latent and active. During the latent phase, irregular contractions become progressively better coordinated, discomfort is minimal, and the cervix effaces and dilates to 4 cm. During the active phase, the cervix becomes fully dilated, and the presenting part descends well into the midpelvis. On average, the active phase lasts 5 to 7 hours in nulliparas and 2 to 4 hours in multiparas. If the membranes have not spontaneously ruptured, some clinicians use amniotomy (artificial rupture of membranes) routinely during the active phase. As a result, labor may progress more rapidly, and meconium-stained amniotic fluid may be detected earlier. Amniotomy during this stage may be necessary for specific indications, such as facilitating internal fetal monitoring to confirm fetal well-being. Amniotomy should be avoided in women with HIV infection or hepatitis B or C, so that the fetus is not exposed to these organisms.",,

What is the most likely cause?  ",Apnea of prematurity,Group B septicemia,Transient tachypnea of newborn,Respiratory distress syndrome,,,2,"Group B streptococcal septicemia is a severe bacterial infection that affects newborn infants. It is caused by the bacteria Streptococcus agalactiae. This bacteria is commonly found in the human gastrointestinal, reproductive, and urinary tracts. If the bacteria travels from the mother's bloodstream through the placenta the infant can become infected. The infant may also become infected if the mother's water breaks (membranes rupture) as the infant passes through the birth canal.The infant may also become infected after delivery. The disease may be seen from birth to 6 days of life (generally in the first 24 hours) or in children age 7 days to 3 months. Most cases occur in babies around 1 month old. Group B streptococcus was once responsible for about 75% of sepsis infections in infants. However, the rate of this condition has dropped since methods to screen and treat pregnant women at risk have been established.Symptoms in the infant may include: anxiety or stress, blue appearance (cyanosis), breathing difficulties such as: grunting, flaring of the nostrils, rapid breathing, short periods without breathing, coma, irregular heart rate - may be fast or extremely slow, irregular heartbeat, lethargy, poor feeding, shock, and unstable body temperature (low or high).

What is the least likely to be included in this patient's management?,Surgery,CPR,EKG,Sulfadiazine,IV fluids,,1,"Electrical injury may result from contact with faulty electrical appliances or machinery or inadvertent contact with household wiring or electrical power lines. The most common entry point for electricity is the hand; the second most common is the head. Often, the main symptom of an electrical injury is a skin burn, although not all electrical injuries cause external damage. High-voltage injuries may cause massive internal burns.A minor shock may cause muscle pain and may trigger mild muscle contractions or startle a person, causing a fall. Severe shocks can cause abnormal heart rhythms, ranging from inconsequential to immediately fatal. Once the person can be safely touched, the rescuer should check to see if the person is breathing and has a pulse. If the person is not breathing and has no pulse, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be started immediately. People with rhabdomyolysis receive large amounts of fluids containing sodium bicarbonate, which is given intravenously. Skin burns are treated with burn cream (such as silver sulfadiazine or bacitracin) and sterile dressings. If the injury is more severe, the person is admitted to the hospital, ideally a burn center. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed to monitor the heartbeat and to look for heart damage.",,

Diagnosis is clinical and based on history. Management consists primarily of education, although some patients with functional impairment require drug therapy. Cyclothymic disorder is commonly a precursor of bipolar II disorder. However, it can also occur as extreme moodiness without becoming a major mood disorder. In chronic hypomania, a form rarely seen clinically, elated periods predominate, with habitual reduction of sleep to  6 hours.

639,5,Psychiatry,Which of the following defense mechanisms is the most mature psychological strategy to cope with a reality?,Projection,Sublimation,Regression,Displacement,,,2,"Defense mechanisms are our way of distancing ourselves from a full awareness of unpleasant thoughts, feelings and desires.Projection is the attribution of one's undesired impulses onto another. For example, a jealous man accuses his wife of cheating.Sublimation is a defense mechanism that allows us to act out unacceptable impulses by converting these behaviors into a more acceptable form. For example, a person experiencing extreme anger might take up kick boxing as a means of venting frustration.Regression is the reversion to an earlier stage of development in the face of unacceptable impulses. For an example an adolescent who is overwhelmed with fear, anger and growing sexual impulses might become clinging and begin thumb sucking or bed wetting.Displacement is the redirecting of thoughts feelings and impulses from an object that gives rise to anxiety to a safer, more acceptable one. Being angry at the boss and kicking the dog can be an example of displacement.",,

What is the appropriate next step? ,Reassurance and follow up after 2 months,IVP,Renal ultrasound,24 hour urine collection for protein,"BUN, creatinine, electrolytes.",,4,"In any child with a positive dipstick result greater than trace for protein, a quantitative estimate of proteinuria should be determined. In older children and adolescents, a 24-hour collection may be performed. The usual rate of excretion of protein is somewhat higher in children than in adults, perhaps as much as 200 mg/d in older children. The dipstick test for protein provides a crude semiquantitative estimation of protein concentration, with results as follows:Trace = 5-20 mg/dL1+ = 30 mg/dL2+ = 100 mg/dL3+ = 300 mg/dL4+ = Greater than 2000 mg/dLThe detection of persistent proteinuria (1+ or protein-to-creatinine ratio of 0.2) in an apparently well child is a signal for potentially serious underlying kidney disease.The next step in the evaluation includes complete history and physical examination (emphasizing blood pressure measurement and evaluation for edema, rashes, and assessment of growth status); quantitative urine protein excretion (protein-to-creatinine ratio of a first-morning urine); examination of the urine sediment for dysmorphic erythrocytes or casts; determination of blood concentrations of BUN, creatinine, electrolytes, albumin, cholesterol, complement, antistreptococcal antibody, antinuclear antibody (ANA), and anti-DNA; and tests for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.More info:Proteinuria is protein, usually albumin, in urine. In many renal disorders, it occurs with other urinary abnormalities (eg, hematuria). Isolated proteinuria is urinary protein without other symptoms or abnormalities. Causes may be categorized as glomerular, tubular, overflow, or physiologic. Exercise proteinuria, sometimes with hematuria, hemoglobinuria, or myoglobinuria, is proteinuria of unknown cause that may occur in runners, boxers, and other people engaged in vigorous exercise.Proteinuria may be transient, orthostatic (occurring only when upright and almost always between adolescence and age 30), or persistent. Most patients with physiologic causes (and many with acute tubulointerstitial disorders) have transient proteinuria; those with transient or orthostatic proteinuria usually excrete  1 g protein/day with no deterioration of renal function, and the proteinuria resolves spontaneously.",,
642,3,PMCH,A pregnant patient of yours is going to Africa for a trip. What will you give her as prophylaxis for malaria?,Chloroquine,Doxycycline,Mefloquine,Atovaquone,,,1,"Use of anti-malarial drugs to prevent the development of malaria is known as chemoprophylaxis. Malaria during pregnancy poses a serious threat to both the mother and fetus. If travel to an endemic area is unavoidable, chemoprophylaxis with at least chloroquine should be given.Chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate can be used for prevention of malaria only in destinations where chloroquine resistance is not present. Prophylaxis should begin 12 weeks before travel to malarious areas. It should be continued by taking the drug once a week, on the same day of the week, during travel in malarious areas and for 4 weeks after a traveler leaves these areas.The other answer choices are contraindicated in pregnancy and/or lactation.",,
643,1,Medicine,What is the most important test for diagnose acute hepatitis A infection? ,Hepatitis A IgG antibody,Hepatitis A IgM antibody,PT/INR,Increased liver function tests,,q569.gif,2,"The above graphic illustrates the diagnostic algorithm in a patient suspected of having acute hepatitis.Hepatitis A virus is present in serum only during acute infection and cannot be detected by clinically available tests. IgM antibody typically develops early in the infection and peaks about 1 to 2 weeks after the development of jaundice. It diminishes within several weeks, followed by the development of protective IgG antibody (IgG anti-HAV), which persists usually for life. Thus, IgM antibody is a marker of acute infection, whereas IgG anti-HAV merely indicates previous exposure to HAV and immunity to recurrent infection.",,

What is the best preventive measure she can take to avoid a similar incident in her customers? ,Keep restrooms clean,"Cook poultry, ground beef, and eggs thoroughly.",Do not add MSG to any food,Turn off all air conditioners," Wash hands, kitchen work surfaces, and utensils with hot water immediately after they have been used.",,2,"Salmonella, primarily produces gastroenteritis, bacteremia, and focal infection. Symptoms may be diarrhea, high fever with prostration, or those of focal infection.Human disease occurs by direct and indirect contact with numerous species of infected animals, the foodstuffs derived from them, and their excreta. Infected meat, poultry, raw milk, eggs, and egg products are common sources of Salmonella. Other reported sources include infected pet turtles and reptiles, carmine red dye, and contaminated marijuana.Drinking water should be purified, sewage should be disposed of effectively, milk should be pasteurized, chronic carriers should avoid handling food, and adequate patient isolation precautions should be implemented. Special attention to enteric precautions is important. Wash hands, kitchen work surfaces, and utensils with soap and water immediately after they have been in contact with raw meat or poultry. Cook poultry, ground beef, and eggs thoroughly. Do not eat or drink foods containing raw eggs, or raw (unpasteurized) milk.Diagnosis is by cultures of blood, stool, or site specimens. Treatment, when indicated, is with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or ciprofloxacin.",,

Average: 11-12 The first sign is typically the beginning of breast growth, including &quot;breast buds.&quot; A girl may also grow considerable height and weight. The first signs of pubic hair start out fine and straight, rather than curly. 3 Age Range: Usually 9-15. Average: 12-13 Breast growth continues, and pubic hair coarsens and becomes darker, but there still isn't a lot of it. The body is still growing, and the vagina is enlarging and may begin to produce a clear or whitish discharge, which is a normal self-cleansing process. Some girls get their first menstrual periods late in this stage. 4 Age Range: Usually 10-16. Average: 13-14 Pubic hair growth takes on the triangular shape of adulthood, but doesn't quite cover the entire area. Underarm hair is likely to appear in this stage, as is menarche. Ovulation (release of egg cells) begins in some girls, but typically not in a regular monthly routine until Stage 5. 5 Age Range: Usually 12-19. Average: 15 This is the final stage of development, when a girl is physically an adult. Breast and pubic hair growth are complete, and your full height is usually attained by this point. Menstrual periods are well established, and ovulation occurs monthly.",,
646,1,Medicine,A 28 year old man with chest pain presents to the ER with increase rate of respiration. On physical exam he has decreased breath sounds on the right side and his trachea is slightly deviated to the left. What is the most appropriate initial management? ,Needle thoracentesis,Chest tube,Albuterol,Epinephrine,,,1,"Pneumothorax is air in the pleural space causing partial or complete lung collapse. Pneumothorax can occur spontaneously or from underlying pulmonary disease, trauma, or medical procedures. Symptoms include dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and anxiety. Dyspnea may be sudden or gradual in onset depending on the rate of development and size of the pneumothorax. Pain can simulate cardiac ischemia, musculoskeletal injury (when referred to the shoulder), or an intra-abdominal process (when referred to the abdomen).Physical findings classically consist of absent tactile fremitus, hyperresonance to percussion, and decreased breath sounds on the side with the pneumothorax. If the pneumothorax is large, the side with the pneumothorax may be enlarged with the trachea visibly shifted to the opposite side.Tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency. It should be treated immediately with needle thoracentesis, followed by placement of chest tube.",,

What is the most likely reason? ,Mild asthma,Normal value,The patient may go into respiratory failure,Moderate asthma,,,3,"In cases of mild asthma the patient usually is able to maintain normal arterial blood oxygen levels. When hyperventilation occurs the CO2 value decreases. In severe disease the patient can no longer maintain the adequate alveolar ventilation and the CO2 levels start to rise.Thus when a patient has a normal or elevated CO2 level during an acute asthmatic episode, it is a sign of severe disease, since it is evidence that the body's need to eliminate CO2 is not being met, because of a decrease in alveolar ventilation.",,
650,1,Medicine,A female patient complains of a severe headache and jaw pain when she chews. She also complains of shoulder pain and bilateral wrist weakness. Initial lab tests show an ESR of 75 (normal is less than 30). What is the most appropriate diagnosis? ,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Temporal Arteritis,Polymyositis,Sarcoidosis,,,2,"Temporal arteritis is a chronic inflammatory disease of large blood vessels, particularly the carotid artery and its branches, occurring primarily in older adults. Simultaneous polymyalgia rheumatica is common. Focal symptoms and signs may include headaches, visual disturbances, temporal artery tenderness, and pain in the jaw muscles while chewing. Fever, weight loss, malaise, and fatigue are also common. ESR is typically very high. Diagnosis is most often by biopsy. Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids is usually highly effective and prevents visual loss.",,

A thiazide diuretic is often the first drug given to treat high blood pressure. Diuretics also help the kidneys eliminate salt and water, decreasing fluid volume throughout the body and thus lowering blood pressure. Diuretics are particularly useful for blacks, older people, obese people, and people with heart failure or chronic kidney failure.Thiazide diuretics are contraindicated in patients with gout. Thiamine, ACEI and beta-blocker are the treatments of choice for hypertensive patients that are alcoholics, diabetics and those with LVH, respectively.",,

Regarding this conversion disorder, all of the following are true, except ",La belle indifference,Involuntary character of the syndrome,Can cause social or professional hindrance,Can be induced voluntarily,,,4,"Conversion disorder consists of symptoms or deficits that develop unconsciously and nonvoluntarity and usually involve motor or sensory function. Manifestations resemble a neurologic or other general medical condition. Onset and maintenance of conversion symptoms are typically attributed to mental factors, such as severe stress (eg death of a loved one). Symptoms often develop abruptly, and onset can usually be linked to a very stressful event. Symptoms are limited to those that affect voluntary motor or sensory function and suggest a neurologic or general medical condition (eg, impaired coordination or balance, weakness, or paralysis of an arm or a leg or loss of sensation in a body part). The symptoms are severe enough to cause distress or disrupt social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. A patient may have a single episode or sporadic repeated ones; symptoms may become chronic. Typically, episodes are brief.La belle indiffrence is considered a classic feature of conversion disorder. It is characterized by the inappropriate and paradoxical absence of distress despite the presence of an unpleasant symptom.",,

Also, beta-blockers can blunt some of the body's responses to hypoglycemia such as rapid heart rate, thus making it difficult for patients to recognize (and treat) hypoglycemic reactions.",,
656,4,Pediatrics,"All of the following are true about Turner syndrome, except: ",Short stature,Amenorrhea,Coarctation of the Aorta,Hirsutism,,,4,"In Turner syndrome (gonadal dysgenesis), girls are born with one of the two X chromosomes partially or completely missing. Many newborns with Turner syndrome have swelling (lymphedema) on the backs of their hands and tops of their feet. Swelling or loose folds of skin are often evident over the back of the neck. Many other abnormalities often develop, including a webbed neck, a low hairline at the back of the neck, a broad chest with wide-spaced nipples, and poorly developed nails.As a girl with Turner syndrome gets older, she has no menstrual periods (amenorrhea), and the breasts, vagina, and labia remain childlike rather than undergoing the changes of puberty. The ovaries usually do not contain developing eggs. A girl or woman with Turner syndrome is virtually always short; obesity is common.Other disorders often develop. Heart defects include narrowing of part of the aorta (coarctation of the aorta). Kidney and eye defects, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid diseases are common.",,
657,1,Medicine,A woman presents with complaints of muscle weakness. Physical exam shows the following rash which you recognize as gottron's papules. See picture: What is the most likely diagnosis? ,Dermatomyositis,Mixed Connective Tissue disease,Scleroderma,Polymyalgia rheumatica,,q583.jpg,1,"In dermatomyositis rashes tend to appear at the same time as muscle weakness and other symptoms. A shadowy-red or purplish rash (heliotrope rash) can appear on the face. A reddish-purple swelling around the eyes is characteristic. Another rash (gottron's papules), which may be scaly, smooth, or raised, may appear almost anywhere on the body but is especially common on the knuckles and sides of the hands. The nail beds may redden. When the rashes fade, brownish pigmentation, scarring, shriveling, or pale depigmented patches may develop on the skin.Criteria used to make the diagnosis of dermatomyositis includes: muscle weakness at the shoulders or hips, a characteristic rash, increased blood levels of certain muscle enzymes (especially creatine kinase), characteristic changes in muscle tissue obtained by biopsy and observed under a microscope, and abnormalities in the electrical activity of muscles measured by electromyographyGenerally, a corticosteroid, usually prednisone, given by mouth in high doses slowly improves strength and relieves pain and swelling, controlling the disease.",,

See picture:What is the most likely diagnosis? ",Herpangina,Herpes simplex stomatitis,Leukoplakia,Erysipelas,,q584.jpg,1,"Herpangina is a febrile disorder caused by numerous group A coxsackie viruses and occasionally other enteroviruses. Infection produces oropharyngeal mucosal vesicular and ulcerative lesions. Herpangina tends to occur in epidemics, most commonly in infants and children. It is characterized by sudden onset of fever with sore throat, headache, anorexia, and frequently, neck pain. Infants may vomit. Within 2 days after onset, up to 20 1- to 2-mm diameter grayish papules develop and become vesicles with erythematous areolae. They occur most frequently on the tonsillar pillars but also on the soft palate, tonsils, uvula, or tongue. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and characteristic oral lesions. It is best confirmed by isolating the virus from the lesions or by demonstrating a rise in specific antibody titer, but such testing is not generally recommended. Treatment of herpangina is symptomatic.",,
659,5,Psychiatry,A male patient has diabetes and hypertension for which he takes propranolol. He comes in with complaint of progressive impotence. He states that because of this he has not had sexual intercourse with his wife for more than 6 months. He admits to you privately that he has had morning erection and also erections when he views adult magazines. What is the appropriate explanation? ,He will need a penile tumescence test,Marital psychotherapy,Stop propranolol,Impotence due to diabetes (vascular problem),,,2,"The most frequent physical causes of erectile dysfunction are vascular (blood vessel) diseases. Vascular diseases may cause problems involving blood flow into the penis to make it erect. They can also cause problems with holding the blood in the penis to maintain the erection. Thus, hardening of the arteries and other diseases that affect the vascular system are risk factors for erectile dysfunction.However this patient is able to achieve erections. Therefore a psychological cause is likely. This includes stress and anxiety due to marital, financial or other personal problems. For example, a man who has lost interest in his spouse may suddenly find himself unable to have an erection with her. It is possible for the man's stress and anxiety to interfere with nerve impulses from his brain when he attempts sexual intercourse.",,
660,4,Pediatrics,"A child who lives in an old building with his mother is found to have microcytic anemia. He also has symptoms of nausea, vomiting, anorexia and constipation, sleep disturbances and irritability. What is the most likely diagnosis? ",Thalassemia,Iron deficiency,Lead poisoning,Vitamin A poisoning, Vitamin B12 deficiency,,3,"Lead paint was commonly used until 1960, used to some degree until the early 1970s, and mostly eliminated in 1978; thus, for a significant number of older housing units, leaded paint still poses some hazard. Lead poisoning is usually caused by direct ingestion of leaded paint chips (from cracked, peeling paint). Lead poisoning is most often a chronic disorder and may not cause acute symptoms. With or without acute symptoms, poisoning eventually has irreversible effects (eg, cognitive deficits, peripheral neuropathy, progressive renal dysfunction).Risk of cognitive deficits increases when the whole blood lead level is  10 mg/dL ( 0.48 mmol/L) for an extended period, although the cutoff may be even lower. Other symptoms (eg, abdominal cramping, constipation, tremors, mood changes) may occur if lead is  50 mg/dL ( 2.4 mmol/L). Encephalopathy is likely if lead is  100 mg/dL ( 4.8 mmol/L).Lead poisoning will show a microcytic anemia with an MCV  80.",,

Which of the following will help you in the diagnosis? ,Ferritin level,Ceruloplasmin,Alpha trypsine,Hb Electrophoresis,,,1,"Primary hemochromatosis is an inherited disorder characterized by excessive iron accumulation causing tissue damage. Symptoms do not develop until organ damage, often irreversible, develops. Symptoms include fatigue, hepatomegaly, bronze skin pigmentation, loss of libido, arthalgias, and manifestations of cirrhosis, diabetes, or cardiomyopathy. Diagnosis is based on serum iron studies and gene assay. Treatment is with serial phlebotomies. Because iron accumulates in multiple sites, symptoms can develop referable to many possible organs or systemically. In women, fatigue and nonspecific constitutional symptoms develop early; in men, cirrhosis or diabetes is often the initial presentation. Serum iron is increased ( 300 mg/dL). Serum transferrin saturation is usually  50% and often  90%. Serum ferritin is increased.",,

663,1,Medicine,An elderly woman who has hypertension and diabetes would benefit most from which of the following medications? ,Metoprolol,Amlodipine,Hydrochlorothiazide,Benazepril,,,4,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors lower blood pressure in part by dilating arterioles. They dilate arterioles by preventing the formation of angiotensin II, which causes arterioles to constrict. Specifically, these inhibitors block the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme, which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II. These drugs are particularly useful for people with coronary artery disease or heart failure, whites, young people, people with protein in their urine because of chronic kidney disease or diabetic kidney disease, and men who develop sexual dysfunction as a side effect of another antihypertensive drug.",,

Clinical presentation depends on whether the onset of hemolysis is gradual or abrupt and on the severity of erythrocyte destruction. A patient with mild hemolysis may be asymptomatic. In more serious cases, the anemia can be life threatening, and patients can present with angina and cardiopulmonary decompensation. An increased reticulocyte count is a criterion for hemolysis but is not specific for hemolysis.",,

The most appropriate diagnostic test to obtain is: ",EKG,Urine culture,Blood culture,Chest X-ray,,,3,"Infective endocarditis is infection of the endocardium, usually with bacteria (commonly, streptococci and staphylococci) or fungi. It produces fever, heart murmurs, petechiae, anemia, embolic phenomena, and endocardial vegetations. Vegetations may result in valvular incompetence or obstruction, myocardial abscess, or mycotic aneurysm. Retinal emboli can cause round or oval hemorrhagic retinal lesions with small white centers (Roth's spots). Cutaneous manifestations include petechiae (on the upper trunk, conjunctivae, mucous membranes, and distal extremities), painful erythematous subcutaneous nodules on the tips of digits (Osler's nodes), nontender hemorrhagic macules on the palms or soles (Janeway lesions), and splinter hemorrhages under the nails.Diagnosis requires demonstration of microorganisms in blood and usually echocardiography.

Hydronephrosis commonly results from an obstruction located at the junction of the ureter and renal pelvis (ureteropelvic junction). Causes of this type of obstruction include the following:Structural abnormalities, for example, a birth defect in which the insertion of the ureter into the renal pelvis is too high or there is inadequate development of the ureteral muscles (congenital ureteropelvic junction obstruction).Hydronephrosis can also result from an obstruction below the ureteropelvic junction or from backflow (reflux) of urine from the bladder. Causes of this type of obstruction include the following:Obstruction in the ureter and an obstruction that prevents urine flow from the bladder to the urethra, resulting from prostate enlargement (most often caused by a condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia, BPH).",,

Most aphasias and related disorders are due to stroke, head injury, cerebral tumors, or degenerative diseases.Broca aphasia syndrome contains a number of distinct components that occur in various combinations. In the complete syndrome, patients present with a nonfluent aphasia. They speak haltingly, without intonation, and have difficulty producing spontaneous speech, naming, and repeating. They may initially be mute, and their articulation may be impaired. Patients are often hypophonic. Comprehension is relatively spared, though it is not normal. Phrases are short and may be telegraphic or agrammatic, including major nouns and verbs but no functor words (articles, adjectives, adverbs, or conjunctions). Patients have telegraphic speech, also called agrammatism. Naming of actions is typically worse than naming of objects.Typically, the lesions in Broca aphasia are localized to the dorsolateral frontal cortex (the posterior two thirds of the inferior frontal gyrus operculum). Broca's area is always localized to just one side of the brain, usually the dominant side, or the one controlling the handed side of the body. This means, for right handed or ambidextrous people, Broca's area is on the left side, and for left handed dominant people, it may occur on the right. ",,

",Brain tumor,Transient ischemic attacks,Meniere's disease,Labyrinthitis,Acoustic neuroma,,4,"Labyrinthitis is a balance disorder. It is an inflammatory process affecting the labyrinths that house the vestibular system (which sense changes in head position) of the inner ear.In addition to balance control problems, a labyrinthitis patient may encounter hearing loss and tinnitus. Labyrinthitis is caused by a virus, but it can also arise from bacterial infection, head injury, an allergy or as a reaction to a particular medicine. Both bacterial and viral labyrinthitis can cause permanent hearing loss, although this is rare.A prominent and debilitating symptom of labyrinthitis is chronic dizziness. The vestibular system is a set of sensory inputs consisting of three semicircular canals, sensing changes in rotational motion, and the otoliths, sensing changes in linear motion. The brain combines visual cues with sensory input from the vestibular system to determine adjustments required to retain balance.",,

Its risk increases with age, smoking, hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol levels), diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure) and is more common in men and those who have close relatives with ischemic heart disease.It is the most common cause of death in most Western countries, and a major cause of hospital admissions. There is limited evidence for population screening, but prevention (with a healthy diet and sometimes medication for diabetes, cholesterol and high blood pressure) is used both to prevent IHD and to decrease the risk of complications.",,
675,1,Medicine,A 60 year old man has an ulcerating carcinoma of the lateral side of the tongue. Which one of the following features has the most important effect upon his management?  ,He smokes 30 cigarettes daily,He has a hard cervical lymph node 1.5 cm in diameter,The tumor measures 2 cm in diameter,The tumor is a squamous cell carcinoma,He has severe dental caries,,2,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma affects about 30,000 Americans each year. Ninety percent are smokers. Alcohol is also a risk factor. Early, curable lesions are rarely symptomatic; thus, preventing fatal disease requires early detection by screening. Treatment is with surgery, radiation, or both. The overall 5-yr survival rate is 52%.If carcinoma of the tongue is localized (no lymph node involvement), 5-yr survival is about 50%. For localized carcinoma of the floor of the mouth, 5-yr survival is 65%. With lymph node metastasis, the 5-yr survival is 20%. For tongue lesions, radiation therapy is often the treatment of choice because surgery is extensive, disfiguring, and associated with poor quality of life. In addition, patients with cancer of the floor of the mouth are often medically compromised and are not good candidates for surgery.",,
676,2,OBGYN,Which one of the following is not an initial screening investigation for infertility? ,History and physical examination,Semen analysis,Basal body temperature charting,Hysteroscopy,,,4,"The process to diagnose the cause for infertility usually begins with physical exams and health and sexual histories. If there are no obvious problems, like poorly timed intercourse or absence of ovulation, tests will be needed. For a man, doctors usually begin by testing his semen. They look at the number, shape, and movement of the sperm. Sometimes doctors also suggest testing the level of a man's hormones. For a woman, the first step in testing is to find out if she is ovulating each month. There are several ways to do this. A woman can track her ovulation at home by recording changes in her morning body temperature (basal body temperature) for several months. Doctors can also check if a woman is ovulating by doing blood tests and an ultrasound of the ovaries. If the woman is ovulating normally, more tests are needed. Hysterosalpingography and laparoscopy can be done after the initial tests if necessary.",,
677,2,OBGYN,A 5 cm right ovarian cyst is found incidentally during the first prenatal examination of an otherwise healthy 22 year old primigravida at 12 weeks gestation. The most likely diagnosis is:  ,A dermoid cyst,A mucinous cystadenoma,An endometrioma,A follicular cyst,A corpus luteum cyst,,5,"An ovarian cyst is an enlargement of the ovary that appears to be filled with fluid. The vast majority of ovarian cysts diagnosed in early pregnancy represent a physiological cyst known as the corpus luteum (cystic or hemorrhagic). This is a normal finding in early pregnancy. The corpus luteum supports the lining of the womb and in turn the pregnancy itself. The corpus luteum does this by producing the pregnancy hormone progesterone which helps nurture the pregnancy. Once the pregnancy gets beyond the 1st trimester, the corpus luteum is no longer needed and therefore this resolves spontaneously, not causing any harm whatsoever to the mother or baby.Most ovarian cysts diagnosed in early pregnancy do not cause any symptoms. They tend to be an incidental finding and women are unaware of their presence. However, if an ovarian cyst ruptures, twists or if there is bleeding into the middle of the cyst, then lower abdominal pain on the side of the ovarian cyst occurs. Most ovarian cysts diagnosed in early pregnancy do not represent ovarian cancer; in fact the risk of ovarian cancer in pregnancy is extremely rare indeed (1 in 15,000 to 1 in 32,000 pregnancies).",,
678,1,Medicine,"A 72 year old man with a history of recently diagnosed small cell cancer of the lung, presents to the emergency room following a witnessed, single, tonic-clonic seizure. His serum sodium is 106 mmol/L. Which one of the following is the best immediate approach to the management of his electrolyte disturbance?  ",Fluid restriction,Intravenous normal saline at 25 mL/hr,Intravenous normal saline at 100 mL/hr,Intravenous 3% saline at 25 mL/hr,Intravenous 3% saline at 100 mL/hr,,5,"Given the presentation, this patient should be treated with Intravenous 3% saline at 100 mL/hr with frequent (q 2 to 4 h) electrolyte determinations. Severe hyponatremia (plasma Na  109 mEq/L; effective osmolality  238 mOsm/kg) in asymptomatic patients can be treated safely with stringent restriction of water intake. However, treatment is more aggressive when neurologic symptoms (eg, confusion, lethargy, seizures, coma) are present. The debate primarily concerns the pace and degree of hyponatremia correction. Many experts recommend that plasma Na be raised no faster than 1 mEq/L/h, but replacement rates of up to 2 mEq/L/h for the first 2 to 3 h have been suggested for patients with seizures. Regardless, the rise should be  10 mEq/L over the first 24 h. More vigorous correction risks precipitation of osmotic demyelination syndrome.Hypertonic (3%) saline (containing 513 mEq Na/L) may be used, but only with frequent (q 2 to 4 h) electrolyte determinations. For patients with seizures or coma,  100 mL/h may be administered over 4 to 6 h in amounts sufficient to raise the serum Na 4 to 6 mEq/L.",,
679,1,Medicine,A 30 year old woman complains to her doctor of swollen lymph nodes in her neck and painful nodules on her lower legs. A chest x-ray shows bilateral hilar and right paratracheal lymphadenopathy. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ,Lymphoma,Metastatic thyroid carcinoma,Teratoma,Wegener's granulomatosis,Sarcoidosis,,5,"Sarcoidosis is characterized by noncaseating granulomas in one or more organs and tissues; etiology is unknown. The lungs and lymphatic system are most often affected, but sarcoidosis may affect any organ. Pulmonary symptoms range from none (limited disease) to exertional dyspnea and, rarely, lung or other organ failure (advanced disease).Diagnosis usually is first suspected because of pulmonary involvement and is confirmed by chest x-ray, biopsy, and exclusion of other causes of granulomatous inflammation. Chest x-ray, or high-resolution chest CT will show hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. First-line treatment is corticosteroids. Prognosis is excellent for limited disease but poor for more advanced disease.",,
680,5,Psychiatry,You are asked to assess a 42 year old man with a history of auditory hallucinations and an admission with a psychotic episode in his early 20's. Which one of the following would be most helpful in distinguishing between a diagnosis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in this man?  ,A history of mania followed by depression,A history of repeated hospital admissions,A history of grandiose delusions,A history of thought disorder,Response to antipsychotics,,1,"Bipolar disorders are characterized by mania and depression, which usually alternate. Exact cause is unknown, but heredity, changes in the level of brain neurotransmitters, and psychosocial factors may be involved. Diagnosis is based on history. Treatment consists of drugs, sometimes with psychotherapy.Schizophrenia is characterized by psychosis (loss of contact with reality), hallucinations (false perceptions), delusions (false beliefs), disorganized speech and behavior, flattened affect (restricted range of emotions), cognitive deficits (impaired reasoning and problem solving), and occupational and social dysfunction. The cause is unknown, but evidence for a genetic component is strong. Symptoms usually begin in adolescence or early adulthood. One or more episodes of symptoms must last &ge; 6 mo before the diagnosis is made. Treatment consists of drug therapy, psychotherapy, and rehabilitation.",,
681,1,Medicine,"A 63 year old man presents with intermittent neurological abnormalities associated with hypoglycemia. The patient experiences an attack in the office, and the physician draws blood for serum insulin, C peptide, and glucose. The attack is relieved by giving the patient glucose. One week later, laboratory results reveal low serum glucose, high serum insulin and low serum C peptide. Which one of the following would result in these clinical and laboratory findings?  ",Insulinoma,Reactive hypoglycemia from eating,Glucagonoma,Insulin taken surreptitiously,,,4,"C-peptide is measured to differentiate insulin produced by the body from insulin injected into the body. When insulin is synthesized by the beta cells of the pancreas, it is produced as a large molecule (a propeptide). This molecule is then split into two pieces: insulin and C-peptide. The function of C-peptide is not known.The C-peptide level may be measured in a patient with type 1 diabetes to see if any insulin is still being produced by the body. It may also be measured in the evaluation of hypoglycemia to see if the person's body is producing too much insulin.Normal values in a patient requiring insulin injections indicate that the person's body is still producing some insulin. Normal values in a patient who has low blood sugar indicate that the patient is making too much insulin.Low values (or no C-peptide) indicate that the person's pancreas is producing little or no insulin.",,
682,4,Pediatrics,"The parents of a 2 year old girl bring her to the Emergency Room. They state that she has been suffering from a cold for five days. They became concerned when she developed a barking cough and noisy breathing. Examination reveals a listless child with a mild fever, inspiratory stridor and diminished breath sounds. Which one of the following is the most likely pathogen?  ",Bordetella pertussis,Streptococcus pneumoniae,Parainfluenza virus,Respiratory syncytial virus,Hemophilus influenzae,,3,"Croup is acute inflammation of the upper and lower respiratory tracts caused most commonly by parainfluenza virus type 1 infection. It is characterized by a barking cough and inspiratory stridor. Diagnosis is usually obvious clinically but can be made by anteroposterior neck x-ray. Treatment is antipyretics, hydration, nebulized racemic epinephrine, and corticosteroids. Prognosis is excellent.",,
683,2,OBGYN,Which of the following medications is contraindicated in the last trimester of pregnancy? ,Sulfonamide,Ampicillin,Diazepam,Heparin,,,1,"Sulfonamides (the sulfa drugs) are safe early in pregnancy, but their use in the last trimester might result in a jaundiced infant. The other medications listed are safe in pregnancy.",,
684,2,OBGYN,Which of the following is not true about IUGR (Intrauterine Growth Retardation)? ,Absence of weight gain,Maternal short stature,Low fundal height,Maternal cigarette smoking,,,2,"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a term used to describe a condition in which the fetus is smaller than expected for the number of weeks of pregnancy. Another term for IUGR is fetal growth restriction. Newborn babies with IUGR are often described as small for gestational age (SGA). A fetus with IUGR often has an estimated fetal weight less than the 10th percentile.Maternal factors associated with IUGR are high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease, advanced diabetes, heart or respiratory disease, malnutrition, anemia, infection, substance abuse (alcohol, drugs) and cigarette smoking.Factors involving the uterus and placenta are decreased blood flow in the uterus and placenta, placental abruption (placenta detaches from the uterus), placenta previa (placenta attaches low in the uterus) and infection in the tissues around the fetus.Factors related to the developing baby (fetus) are multiple gestation (twins, triplets, etc.), infection, birth defects and chromosomal abnormality.",,
5884,4,Pediatrics,A child's sweat chloride test value is 65 mmol/L (normal &lt; 60 mmol/L). He will very likely suffer from:,Mild gastrointestinal inflammation,Profuse perspiration,"Chest pain, dyspnea and Horner's","Severe lung disease, pancreatic insufficiency and infertility","Peripheral edema, eosinophilia, cardiomyopathy",,4,"Cystic fibrosis (CF)CF can affect a multitude of organ systems (GI, MSK, Endocrine, Cardiovascular, Respiratory and GU). Its hallmark manifestations are poor growth, difficulty breathing &amp; lung infections (due to decreased mucociliary clearance and inflammation); infertility (especially in males due to a congenital absence of the vas deferens) and gastrointestinal malabsorption (due to insufficient pancreatic enzymes).CF is caused by a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene which codes for a membrane transport protein involved in controlling the movement of halogens (such as chloride) in and out of cells. Along with the sweat chloride test, investigations include: CXR, PFT's and ABG's. Management of CF involves respiratory rehabilitation, bronchodilation, antibiotics, mucolytics, and lung transplant.Mild gastrointestinal inflammation (a) and profuse perspiration or hyperhidrosis (b) can manifest from a number of etiologies. Chest pain, dyspnea and Horner's syndrome (c) are suggestive of a mediastinal mass. Peripheral edema, eosinophilia and cardiomyopathy (e) are characteristic of Loeffler's endocarditis.PEARL: The hallmark systems affected by CF are the Respiratory, GI and Reproductive systems.",,
686,1,Medicine,"An elderly patient presents for treatment of head trauma. He develops changes in behavior with frequent vomiting and headache. All of the following are indicated initially, except: ",Head CT,Catheter,IV Fluids,Lumbar puncture,,,4,CT scanning of the head is done before lumbar puncture because the most worrisome contraindication to lumbar puncture is the suspicion of increased ICP due to a cerebral mass lesion. Performing a lumbar puncture in these patients may lead to either trans-tentorial or uncal herniation and acute neurological deterioration.,,
687,1,Medicine,"A patient, who ate a lot of meat at a barbeque, develops diarrhea and muscle pain. His symptoms have been present for two weeks now. His initial complete blood count shows eosinophilia. What is the best investigation to be done to reach the diagnosis? ",Muscle biopsy,Stool culture,Stool gram stain,Stool ova and parasites,,,1,"Trichinosis is infection with Trichinella spiralis or related Trichinella species. Symptoms include initial GI irritation followed by periorbital edema, muscle pain, fever, and eosinophilia. Humans become infected by eating raw, undercooked, or processed meat from infected animals, most commonly pigs, wild boar, or bear.Diagnosis is clinical and with serologic tests. Muscle biopsy may be diagnostic but is seldom necessary. Treatment is with mebendazole or albendazole plus prednisone if symptoms are severe.No specific tests to diagnose the intestinal stage are available. After the 2nd weeks of infection, a muscle biopsy may disclose larvae and cysts but is seldom necessary. Diffuse inflammation in muscle tissue indicates recent infection.",,
688,1,Medicine,"An elderly patient with long standing rheumatoid arthritis who has been taking medications for it, develops tinnitus. What is the most likely cause? ",Aspirin toxicity,Meneire disease,Labyrinthitis,Acoustic neuroma,,,1,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease, producing damage mediated by cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteases. Peripheral joints (eg, wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints) are symmetrically inflamed, often resulting in progressive destruction of articular structures, usually accompanied by systemic symptoms. Diagnosis requires specific clinical, laboratory, and radiologic criteria. If a patient takes aspirin daily (for RA, for example), it can cause or worsen tinnitus. For this reason, aspirin is no longer used for RA, as effective doses are often toxic.",,
689,4,Pediatrics,An infant child develops abdominal obstruction. His history includes no passing of meconium on the first day of life. You suspect hirschsprung's disease. What is the method for definitive diagnosis? ,Barium enema,Colonic transit time with radio opaque markers,X-ray,Rectal biopsy,,,4,"In Hirschsprung's disease (congenital megacolon), a section of the large intestine is missing the nerve network that controls the intestine's rhythmic contractions. At the time of birth, newborns should pass a dark green fecal material (meconium). Delayed passage of meconium raises the suspicion of Hirschsprung's disease. Later in infancy, children with Hirschsprung's disease can have symptoms that suggest intestinal obstruction, bile-stained vomit, a swollen abdomen, and refusal to eat. Rectal biopsy and measurement of the pressure inside the rectum (manometry) are the only tests that can reliably be used to diagnose Hirschsprung's disease. A barium enema may also be performed. During a barium enema, the doctor instills barium and air into the child's rectum and then takes x-rays.",,
690,1,Medicine,A man complains that recently when he shaves he has a shooting type of pain in his face. It happens once in a while and then goes away. You suspect trigeminal neuralgia. What is the treatment of choice? ,Fluoxetine,Prednisone,Acyclovir,Carbamazepine,,,4,"Trigeminal neuralgia is severe paroxysmal facial pain due to a disorder of the 5th cranial nerve. Pain occurs along the distribution of one or more sensory divisions of the trigeminal nerve, most often the maxillary. The pain is paroxysmal, lasting seconds up to 2 min, but attacks may recur rapidly. It is lancinating, excruciating, and sometimes incapacitating. Pain is often precipitated by stimulating a facial trigger point (eg, by chewing, brushing the teeth, or smiling). Sleeping on that side of the face is often intolerable.Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment is usually with carbamazepine or gabapentin; sometimes surgery is required.",,
691,1,Medicine,A 45 year old man presents with acute pleuritic chest pain. He is sitting up in bed leaned forward when you enter the examining room. Physical exam reveals a friction rub on cardiac exam. Which of the following is appropriate in treatment? ,Antiarrhythmic,Beta-blocker,Albuterol,Naproxen,,,4,"Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium, often with fluid accumulation. Pericarditis may be caused by many disorders (eg, infection, MI, trauma, tumors, metabolic disorders) but is often idiopathic. Symptoms include chest pain or tightness, often worsened by deep breathing. Unlike ischemic chest pain, pain due to pericarditis is usually aggravated by thoracic motion, cough, breathing, or swallowing food; it may be relieved by sitting up and leaning forward. Diagnosis is based on symptoms, a friction rub, ECG changes, and evidence of pericardial fluid accumulation on x-ray or echocardiogram. Finding the cause requires further evaluation. Treatment depends on the cause, but general measures include analgesics (eg codeine), anti-inflammatory drugs (eg naproxen), and sometimes surgery.",,
692,1,Medicine,A patient on clozapine has to be concerned with which of the following side effects?,Dystonia,Tardive dyskinesia,Decreased white blood cell count,Parkinson,,,3,"Clozapine is used in the management of psychotic disorders including schizophrenia. Because of concern for the side effect of agranulocytosis, clozapine should be reserved for patients who have failed to respond to other standard medications or who are at risk for recurring suicidal behavior.Clozapine may cause a severe reduction in white blood cell count, a condition known as agranulocytosis, in approximately 1 in 100 patients who take it for at least one year. White blood cells fight infections, and a severe reduction in white blood cells can result in severe infections. If not caught early, agranulocytosis can be fatal. Therefore, the white blood cell count should be measured (with a blood test) prior to starting treatment and regularly (weekly) while patients receive this medication, and for 4 weeks after it is stopped.",,

He also has recently had some inappropriate loud outbursts at work. Which of the following disorders is likely? ",Tourette,Schizophrenia,Tic douloureux,Panic disorder,,,1,"Tourette's syndrome is a hereditary tic disorder that begins in childhood. TS is usually diagnosed in children and adolescents aged 6-17 years. Symptoms include simple, complex, and vocal tics. The movement disorder may begin with simple tics (eg, facial grimacing, head jerking, blinking, sniffing) that progress to multiple complex tics, including respiratory and vocal ones (eg, loud, irritating vocalizations; snorting). Vocal tics may begin as grunting or barking noises and evolve into compulsive utterances that are often loud or shrill. Patients may voluntarily suppress tics for seconds or minutes. Coprolalia (involuntary scatologic or obscene utterances) occurs in a few patients. Severe tics and coprolalia are physically and socially disabling. Echolalia (immediate repetition of one's own or another person's words or phrases) is common. Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment may include clonidine or antipsychotics.",,

",Chest x-ray,EKG,Urine culture,Sputum culture,Blood culture,,5,"Because splenectomy causes an increased risk of overwhelming sepsis due to encapsulated organisms (such as S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae) the patient should be immunized, if possible, prior to removal of the spleen.An increase in blood leukocytes can occur following a splenectomy. Failure to do so later puts the patient at risk of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI), a potentially rapidly fatal septicemia. These bacteria often cause a sore throat under normal circumstances but after splenectomy, when infecting bacteria cannot be adequately opsonized, the infection becomes more severe.It is important to do blood cultures in a post-splenectomy patient who presents with fever and signs of infection, to isolate the organism.",,

Symptoms of sialolithiasis may include: swollen glands around the neck, mouth pain, mouth tenderness, redness, swelling around the mouth, neck pain or swelling.Risk factors for developing sialolithiasis include: dehydration, which thickens the saliva, not eating a lot, which decreases the demand for saliva. Medications that decrease saliva production, including certain antihistamines, blood pressure drugs and psychiatric medications. If the stones cause a blockage within the salivary glands, it can lead to a painful, infection called sialadenitis.",,
698,2,OBGYN,Oligohydramnios is associated with which of the following fetal conditions? ,Tracheo-esophageal fistula,Talipes equinovarus (club foot),Anencephaly,Fetal erythoblastosis,Down syndrome,,2,"Potter syndrome is a term used to describe the typical physical appearances of a fetus or neonate due to a dramatically decreased amniotic fluid volume oligohydramnios, or absent amniotic fluid anhydramnios, secondary to renal diseases such as bilateral renal agenesis. Other causes of Potter syndrome can be obstruction of the urinary tract, polycystic or multicystic kidney diseases, renal hypoplasia and rupture of the amniotic sac. The decreased volume of amniotic fluid causes the growing fetus to become compressed by the mother's uterus. This compression can cause many physical deformities of the fetus, most common of which is Potter facies. Lower extremity anomalies are frequent in these cases, which often presents with clubbed feet and/or bowing of the legs.",,

The first thing you should do is: ",Call a close relative and inquire about any new drug intake,Install a nasogastric tube,Administer 35-40 % FiO2 by nasal canula,Perform endotracheal intubation,Order EKG and chest x-ray and reassess,,4,"ABC is a mnemonic for memorizing essential steps in dealing with an unconscious or unresponsive patient. It stands for Airway, Breathing and Circulation.If the patient's airway is blocked, oxygen cannot reach the lungs and so cannot be transported round the body in the blood. Ensuring a clear airway is the first step in treating any patient. Common problems with the airway involve blockage by the tongue or vomit.Initial opening of the airway is often achieved by a &quot;head tilt &mdash; chin lift&quot; or jaw thrust technique, although further maneuvers such as intubation may be necessary. The patient is next assessed for breathing. Common findings during an assessment of breathing may include normal breathing, noisy breathing, gasping or coughing. The rescuer proceeds to act on these based on his/her training. Generally at this point it will become clear whether or not the casualty needs supportive care (such as the recovery position) or rescue breathing.Once oxygen can be delivered to the lungs by a clear airway and efficient breathing, there needs to be a circulation to deliver it to the rest of the body. This can be assessed in a number of ways, including a pulse check, ECG analysis, or capillary refill time.",,

Symptoms, generally milder in hereditary elliptocytosis, include variable degrees of anemia, jaundice, and splenomegaly. The red cell count and hemoglobin are moderately reduced. Some of the asymptomatic patients detected by family surveys have normal red cell counts when first seen. The red cells are usually normocytic, but microcytosis may occur. Macrocytosis may present during periods of marked reticulocytosis. Spherocytes in varying numbers, sizes, and shapes are seen on a Wright-stained smear. The reticulocyte count is increased to 5-20%. The indirect serum bilirubin and stool urobilinogen are usually elevated, and serum haptoglobin is usually decreased to absent. The Coombs test is negative. Osmotic fragility is increased; hemolysis of 5-10% of cells may be observed at saline concentrations of 0.6%.

Primary dysmenorrhea begins during adolescence and cannot be explained by structural gynecologic disorders. Usually, secondary dysmenorrhea begins during adulthood and is due to underlying pelvic abnormalities. Diagnosis is clinical and by exclusion of structural disorders with pelvic ultrasonography and tests directed at any other clinically suspected causes. Underlying disorders are treated. Pain is treated with NSAIDs and sometimes with low-dose estrogen-progestin contraceptives. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) block the Cox enzymes and reduce prostaglandins throughout the body. As a consequence, ongoing inflammation, pain, and fever are reduced.",,

Chronic tendon deterioration or inflammation can cause scars that restrict motion.Volar flexor tenosynovitis is one of the most common musculoskeletal entities and is often overlooked. Pain occurs in the palm on the volar aspect of the thumb or other digits and may radiate distally. The diagnosis is made by eliciting tenderness on palpation of the tendon and sheath and by noting swelling and possibly a nodule. In later stages, triggering or snapping of the digit occurs on flexion (trigger finger).Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment includes rest, NSAIDs, and sometimes corticosteroid injections.",,
708,6,Surgery,"Following a car accident, a patient presents with a clear fluid leaking from his ear and bruising in the mastoid region (Battle's sign). Which one of the following injuries is most likely?  ",Foramen magnum fracture,Fracture of the supraorbital ridge,Anterior cranial fossa fracture,Temporal bone fracture,Ethmoid bone fracture,q6331.jpg,4,"Temporal bone fractures can occur after severe blunt trauma to the head and sometimes involve structures of the ear, causing hearing loss, vertigo, balance disturbance, or facial paralysis. Temporal bone fractures are suggested by Battle's sign (postauricular ecchymosis) and bleeding from the ear. Bleeding may come from the middle ear (hemotympanum) through a ruptured tympanic membrane or from a fracture line in the ear canal. A hemotympanum makes the tympanic membrane appear blue-black. CSF otorrhea indicates a communication between the middle ear and the subarachnoid space. Temporal bone fractures account for the most common cause of CSF otorrhea.",,

The urine specific gravity is 1.001, and the serum sodium 137 mmol/L. After 8 hours with no fluid intake, the urine specific gravity is 1.024 and the serum sodium 141 mmol/L. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  ",Primary polydipsia,Chronic renal failure,Neurogenic (central) diabetes insipidus,Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus,Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion,,1,"Primary polydipsia, also termed psychogenic diabetes insipidus, or compulsive water drinking. It is a condition in which the subject experiences a powerful need to ingest fluid and presents with polyuria and polydipsia and a plasma osmolarity lower than the normal, perhaps as low as or lower than 270 mOsm/L. The synthesis, secretion, nephron sensitivity to ADH and the osmoreceptor response are all intact and operative in these subjects. The hallmark of this disease, is plasma hypo-osmolarity in the presence of polyuria and the ability to form a maximally concentrated urine when deprived of water or when ADH is administered. As noted above in central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus the polyuria precedes and is the cause of the polydipsia. In the case of psychogenic diabetes insipidus the polydipsia precedes and is the cause of the polyuria.",,

She has had some joint aching and been feeling unwell for a few days. Her malar rash is about the same as usual for her. Which one of the following suggests she is experiencing an exacerbation of her disease?  ,C3 and C4 are both normal,C3 is low and C4 is normal,"CH50, C3 and C4 are normal",C3 and C4 are low,,,4,"Serum complement levels (C3 and C4) indicate consumption of immune complexes. In other words, complement plays a substantial role in the clearance of immune complexes and/or apoptotic debris, which is thought to be impaired in lupus. Elevated or normal serum complement levels indicate that immune complexes are being cleared. During a lupus exacerbation, immune complexes are not cleared from the body. Therefore, decreasing serum complement levels are consistent with exacerbation of the disease (lupus flare). ",,
713,1,Medicine,"A 60 year old man with easy fatigability was found to have hypercalcemia, decreased parathyroid hormone level, normal blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, and increased urinary excretion of calcium. A chest X-ray showed an irregular density in the right upper lobe of the lung. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  ",Multiple myeloma,Sarcoidosis,Primary hyperparathyroidism,Paraneoplastic syndrome,Laboratory error,,4,"Paraneoplastic syndromes occur when a cancer produces one or more substances that circulate in the bloodstream to cause symptoms at sites distant from the tumor. These substances can affect the function of other tissues and organs, resulting in a variety of symptoms. Paraneoplastic syndromes may affect many different organ systems, including the nervous system and the endocrine (hormone) system, causing such problems as low blood sugar, diarrhea, or high blood pressure. Small cell carcinoma of the lung may secrete a substance that stimulates the adrenal gland to produce increased hormone levels, which can cause weakness, weight gain, and high blood pressure (Cushing's syndrome). Small cell carcinoma of the lung may also produce antidiuretic hormone, causing water retention, decreased sodium levels, weakness, confusion, and seizures in some people. Very high calcium levels in the blood (hypercalcemic syndrome) may occur in people with solid tumors or leukemias. This can occur when the cancer secretes a hormone-like substance in the blood that causes release of calcium from bone. High calcium levels may also result if the cancer directly invades bone, thereby releasing calcium into the bloodstream. As a result of the high calcium levels in the blood, the person develops confusion, which can progress to coma and even death.",,

His blood pressure is 110/85 mmHg, his pulse 115 beats per minute; his face is flushed, and he is diaphoretic. During the physical examination, splenomegaly and a venous pattern on his chest and abdomen are noted. He seems somewhat drowsy and confused but has no focal neurologic signs. What is the most likely cause of this patient's bleeding?  ",Portal hypertension,Hemoglobin deficiency,Gastric ulcer,Bronchogenic carcinoma,Factor VIII deficiency,,1,"Long term complications of hemochromatosis include liver cirrhosis. Portal hypertension is caused most often by cirrhosis (in developed countries), schistosomiasis (in endemic areas), or hepatic vascular abnormalities. Consequences include esophageal varices and portal-systemic encephalopathy. Portal hypertension is asymptomatic; symptoms and signs result from its complications. The most dangerous is acute esophageal variceal bleeding. Patients typically present with sudden painless upper GI bleeding, often massive. Bleeding from portal hypertensive gastropathy is often subacute or chronic. Ascites, splenomegaly, or portal-systemic encephalopathy may be present.Portal hypertension is inferred in a patient with chronic liver disease by the presence of collateral circulation, splenomegaly, ascites, or portal-systemic encephalopathy. Proof requires direct portal pressure measurement by a transjugular catheter, which is invasive and usually not performed. Imaging may help when cirrhosis is suspected. Ultrasound or CT often reveals dilated intra-abdominal collaterals, and Doppler ultrasound can determine portal vein patency and flow.Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria, often in conjunction with imaging studies and endoscopy. Treatment involves prevention of GI bleeding with endoscopy, drugs, or both, and sometimes with portocaval shunting.",,

What is the most likely diagnosis?  ",Patent ductus arteriosus,Ventricular septal defect,Coarctation of the aorta,Aortic stenosis,Mitral valve prolapse,,3,"Coarctation of the aorta is localized narrowing of the aortic lumen that results in upper-extremity hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and malperfusion of the abdominal organs and lower extremities. Symptoms vary with the anomaly's severity and range from headache, chest pain, cold extremities, fatigue, and leg claudication to fulminant heart failure and shock. A soft bruit may be heard over the coarctation site. Diagnosis is by echocardiography or by CT or MR angiography. Treatment is balloon angioplasty with stent placement, or surgical correction. Endocarditis prophylaxis is recommended.",,
719,4,Pediatrics,The disappearance of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) murmur in a patient known to have a large left-to-right shunt is most likely due to:  ,Development of aortic stenosis,Closure of ventricular septal defect (VSD),Increase in the left-to-right shunt,Development of pulmonary stenosis,Development of significant pulmonary arterial hypertension,,5,"A ventricular septal defect is one or more openings in the interventricular septum, producing a shunt between ventricles. Large defects result in a significant left-to-right shunt and produce dyspnea with feeding and poor growth. A loud, harsh, holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border is common. Recurrent respiratory infections and heart failure may develop. Diagnosis is by echocardiography. Defects may close spontaneously during infancy or require surgical repair. Endocarditis prophylaxis is recommended. Eisenmenger's syndrome or Eisenmenger's reaction is defined as the process in which a left-to-right shunt in the heart causes increased flow through the pulmonary vasculature, causing pulmonary hypertension, which in turn, causes increased pressures in the right side of the heart and reversal of the shunt into a right-to-left shunt.",,
720,4,Pediatrics,A 5 year old boy is admitted with a provisional diagnosis of acute renal failure. The laboratory calls you to report that his serum potassium level is 7.5 mmol/L. Which one of the following should be your next investigation?  ,Electrocardiogram,Serum creatinine,White cell count,Serum sodium,Serum bicarbonate,,1,"Hyperkalemia is serum K concentration  5.5 mEq/L resulting from excess total body K stores or abnormal movement of K out of cells. The usual cause is impairment of renal excretion; it can also occur in metabolic acidosis as in uncontrolled diabetes. Clinical manifestations are generally neuromuscular, resulting in muscle weakness and cardiac toxicity that, if severe, can degenerate to ventricular fibrillation or asystole. Moderate to severe hyperkalemia: Plasma K  6 mEq/L, especially with EKG changes, requires aggressive therapy to shift K into cells. Administration of 10 to 20 mL 10% Ca gluconate (or 5 to 10 mL 22% Ca gluceptate) IV over 5 to 10 min. Ca antagonizes the effect of hyperkalemia on cardiac muscle excitability. If the ECG has deteriorated to a sine wave or asystole, Ca gluconate may be given more rapidly (5 to 10 mL IV over 2 min). CaCl can also be used but can be irritating and should be given through a central venous catheter.",,

723,6,Surgery,"A laborer feels a sharp pain in his right shoulder as he is lifting a heavy crate. On examination, he has moderate pain and soreness in the right shoulder. The shoulder can be moved passively through most of the range, but active abduction can be achieved only if assisted. The most likely diagnosis is  ",Rupture of the tendon of the long head of biceps,Subglenoid dislocation of the shoulder,Axillary nerve injury,Acute subdeltoid bursitis,Partial rupture of the rotator cuff,,5,"The rotator cuff, consisting of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis (SITS) muscles, helps stabilize the humerus in the glenoid fossa of the scapula during many athletic overhead arm motions (eg, pitching, swimming, weightlifting, serving in racket sports). Disorders can involve strain, tendinitis, or a partial or complete tear.Symptoms of bursitis include shoulder pain, especially with overhead activity, and weakness. The pain usually is worse between 80 and 120 (painful arc of motion) of shoulder abduction or flexion and is usually minimal or absent at  80 or  120. Signs vary by severity. Incomplete tendon tears and tendinitis produce similar symptoms.The supraspinatus is assessed by having the patient resist downward pressure on the arms held in forward flexion with the thumbs pointing downward (empty can test).The infraspinatus and teres minor are assessed by having the patient resist external rotation pressure with the arms held at the sides with elbows flexed to 90; this position isolates rotator cuff muscle function from that of other muscles such as the deltoid. Weakness during this test suggests significant rotator cuff dysfunction (eg, a complete tear).The subscapularis is assessed by having the patient resist internal rotation pressure or by having the patient place the back of the hand on the back and then try to lift the hand off (lift-off test).",,
724,6,Surgery,"A 75 year old woman complains of having to swallow her food twice, accompanied by gurgling noises in her throat. The most likely diagnosis is  ",Achalasia,Myotonic dystrophy,Gastroesophageal reflux,Cricopharyngeal diverticulum,Myasthenia gravis,q648.jpg,4,"Cricopharyngeal diverticulum or Zenker diverticulum is a pouch that develops in the walls of the lower throat. It usually occurs in people over age 50. With every swallow, some food ends up in the pouch until the pouch fills. Once filled, the pouch presses on the upper esophagus, making it difficult for solid foods to pass. The filled pouch also spills food into the throat, causing coughing and spitting up of food swallowed many hours before; this especially happens when lying down at night. The pouch also causes problems for patients taking medications, because pills can get stuck in the pouch and are not absorbed through the stomach. The cause of Zenker's diverticulum is unknown, but it is thought to be due to a weak spot in the lower throat muscles.",,

Which nerve is most likely to have been injured during the procedure?  ",Peroneal,Sural,Tibial,Saphenous,Femoral,,1,"Peroneal nerve palsy is the term used when the nerve at the top of the calf behind the knee is compressed. If the peroneal nerve is injured, it cannot support the tibialis anterior, the muscle which lifts the foot. To diagnose foot drop, a physician will take a complete medical history and may order tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or an electromyogram (EMG).",,
726,5,Psychiatry,Hypertensive encephalopathy may be precipitated in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors with the ingestion of foods containing high levels of which one of the following?  ,Tyramine,Tryptophan,Serotonin,Tyrosine,Dopamine,,1,"Antidepressants known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors work by blocking the breakdown of neurotransmitters (NT's). When the excess NT's don't get destroyed, they start piling up in the brain. And since depression is associated with low levels of these NT's, increasing the NT's ease depressive symptoms.Unfortunately, monoamine oxidase doesn't just destroy those neurotransmitters; it's also responsible for mopping up another amine called tyramine, a molecule that affects blood pressure. So when monoamine oxidase gets blocked, levels of tyramine begin to rise, too. And that's when the trouble starts.While a hike in neurotransmitters is beneficial, an increase in tyramine is disastrous. Excess tyramine can cause a sudden, sometimes fatal increase in blood pressure so severe that it can burst blood vessels in the brain.Every time you eat chicken liver, aged cheese, broad-bean pods, or pickled herring, tyramine floods into your brain. Normally, MAO enzymes take care of this potentially harmful tyramine excess. But if you're taking an MAO inhibitor, the MAO enzyme can't stop tyramine from building up. This is exactly what happened when the drugs were introduced in the 1960s. Because no one knew about the tyramine connection, a wave of deaths from brain hemorrhages swept the country. Other patients taking MAO inhibitors experienced severe headaches caused by the rise in blood pressure.",,

She has been sexually active since she was 15 and is seeing a gynecologist for follow-up of cervical dysplasia. Rheumatoid factor was negative. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  ,Osteoarthritis,Gouty arthritis,Pseudogout,Gonococcal arthritis,Systemic lupus erythematosus,,4,"Gonococcal arthritis is a more focal form of disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) that results in a frank septic arthritis with effusion. Some patients have previous or coincident symptoms of DGI. Usually only 1 or 2 joints are involved, primarily the knees, ankles, wrists, and elbows. Onset is often acute, with fever, severe pain, and limitation of movement but may occur without constitutional symptoms. Infected joints are swollen, and the overlying skin may be warm and red.In 30 to 40% of patients with DGI, blood cultures are positive in the 1st week of illness. With septic arthritis, blood cultures are less often positive, but joint fluids are more often positive. Isolated, frank, acute arthritis in a sexually active patient requires joint aspiration to diagnose gonococcal infection. Fluid is usually purulent (WBCs  20,000/L). Cultures of joint fluid are positive in 40 to 50%, but organisms are rarely visible on Gram stain. PCR testing may be more sensitive but has not been evaluated.",,

Which one of the following is the most important investigation to order at this time?  ,A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain,An echocardiogram,Cerebral angiography,Chest x-ray,Carotid artery ultrasound,,5,"A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is focal brain ischemia producing sudden neurologic deficits that last  1 hour.Most TIAs are caused by emboli, usually from carotid or vertebral arteries, although most of the causes of ischemic stroke can also result in TIAs. The cause of a TIA is sought as for that of ischemic strokes, including tests for carotid stenosis via a carotid ultrasound, cardiac sources of emboli, atrial fibrillation, and hematologic abnormalities and screening for stroke risk factors. Because risk of subsequent ischemic stroke is high and immediate, evaluation proceeds rapidly, usually on an inpatient basis. It is not clear which patients, if any, can be safely discharged from the emergency department.",,

A congo red special stain demonstrates apple green birefringence. Which one of the following conditions is the most likely explanation?  ",Sarcoidosis,Histoplasmosis,Amyloidosis,Mesothelioma,Silicosis,,3,"Amyloidosis is any of a group of disparate conditions characterized by extracellular deposition of various insoluble proteins. These proteins may accumulate locally, causing relatively few symptoms, or widely, involving multiple organs and producing severe multiorgan failure. Amyloidosis can be primary or be secondary to various infectious, inflammatory, or malignant conditions. Rarely, it results from any of several inherited metabolic defects. Diagnosis is by biopsy of affected tissue. Amyloid deposits may be formed from at least 18 different proteins, including immunoglobulin fragments. Amyloid deposits are metabolically inert but interfere physically with organ structure and function. All stain positive with Congo red dye, stain pink with hematoxylin and eosin, and have apple-green birefringence under polarized light after Congo red staining.

738,4,Pediatrics,"A previously well 13 year old boy experiences a sudden onset of pain in the right testicle with accompanying nausea and vomiting. On examination 8 hours after the onset of pain, the testicle is located high in the scrotum and is swollen and exquisitely tender. The overlying epididymis cannot be separately palpated. The most likely diagnosis is:  ",Acute epididymitis,Torsion of the spermatic cord,Incarcerated inguinal hernia,Testicular tumor,,,2,"Testicular torsion is an emergency condition due to rotation of the testis and consequent strangulation of its blood supply. Symptoms are acute scrotal pain and swelling, nausea, and vomiting. Diagnosis is based on physical examination and confirmed by color Doppler.

740,1,Medicine,"A 20 year old man presents with respiratory distress. You establish that he has a severe acute asthmatic attack. In addition to oxygen, which one of the following is the most important medication he requires?  ",Morphine,Corticosteroids,Albuterol,Montelukast sodium,Sodium cromoglycate,,3,"An asthma attack can be frightening, both to the person experiencing it and to others around. Even when relatively mild, the symptoms provoke anxiety and alarm. A severe asthma attack is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate, skilled, professional care. If not treated adequately and quickly, a severe asthma attack can cause death.Supplemental oxygen may be given during attacks. However, in severe attacks, a doctor also needs to monitor carbon dioxide levels, and this test requires a sample of blood from an artery. Short-acting beta-adrenergic agonists (eg albuterol) are usually the best drugs for relieving asthma attacks. Most beta-receptor agonists, especially the inhaled ones, act within minutes, but the effects last only 2 to 6 hours. They are given by mouth in higher doses for people experiencing severe attacks. Corticosteroids given by mouth are generally continued for at least several days after a severe attack.",,
741,1,Medicine,A 67 year old woman develops delirium 3 days after an acute myocardial infarction. She is markedly agitated. Which one of the following is the most useful treatment?  ,Diazepam,Morphine,Nitroglycerine,Chlorpromazine,Haloperidol,,5,"Delirium is an acute, transient, usually reversible, fluctuating disturbance in attention, cognition, and consciousness level. Causes include almost any disorder, intoxication, or drug. Diagnosis is clinical, with laboratory and usually imaging tests to identify the cause. Treatment is correction of the cause and supportive measures. Drugs given to treat delirium typically include low-dose haloperidol, may lessen agitation or psychotic symptoms; occasionally, much higher doses are necessary. However, drugs do not correct the underlying problem and may prolong or exacerbate delirium. Second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics (eg, risperidone) may be used instead because they have fewer extrapyramidal adverse effects; however, long-term use in patients with dementia may increase risk of stroke and death.",,
742,1,Medicine,A 45 year old woman is brought to the Emergency Department after she fainted in a supermarket. Her husband tells you she was diagnosed as hypoglycemic by a physician 2 years ago. Which one of the following criteria is most in favor of the diagnosis of hypoglycemia?  ,Abnormal 72 hour fasting test,Low blood glucose while symptomatic,Typical prodrome of tachycardia,History of post-prandial syncope,,,1,"Hypoglycemia unrelated to exogenous insulin therapy is an uncommon clinical syndrome characterized by low plasma glucose level, symptomatic sympathetic nervous system stimulation, and CNS dysfunction. Many drugs and disorders cause it. A 72 hour fast performed in a controlled setting is the standard for diagnosis. Patients drink only noncaloric, noncaffeinated beverages, and plasma glucose is measured at baseline, whenever symptoms occur, and q 4 to 6 h or q 1 to 2 h if glucose falls below 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L). Serum insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin should be measured at times of hypoglycemia to distinguish endogenous from exogenous (factitious) hypoglycemia. The fast is terminated at 72 hour if the patient has experienced no symptoms and glucose remains normal, sooner if glucose decreases to  45 mg/dL ( 2.5 mmol/L) in the presence of hypoglycemic symptoms.",,

Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment is with levodopa plus carbidopa, other drugs, and, for refractory symptoms, surgery.A resting tremor of one hand is often the first symptom. The tremor is characterized as follows: Often involving the wrist and fingers in movements similar to those used to manipulate small objects or pills (pill-rolling tremor) Usually, the hands, arms, and legs are most affected, in that order. Dementia can occur. Hypokinesia and impaired control of distal musculature cause micrographia (writing in very small letters) and make activities of daily living increasingly difficult.Intention tremor is a dyskinetic disorder consisting of wide tremor during voluntary movements. A tremor that gets worse when a person is moving or reaching for an object is called an intention tremor. It is the result of dysfunction of the cerebellum.",,

",Random plasma aldosterone/plasma renin activity ratio,24-hour urine collection for catecholamines and creatinine,24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor,24-hour urine collection for cortisol,Nuclear medicine captopril renal scan,,1,"Aldosterone, a hormone produced and secreted by the adrenal glands, signals the kidneys to excrete less sodium and more potassium. Hyperaldosteronism can be caused by a tumor (usually a noncancerous adenoma) in the adrenal gland (a condition called Conn's syndrome), although sometimes both glands are involved and are overactive. Sometimes hyperaldosteronism is a response to certain diseases, such as very high blood pressure (hypertension) or narrowing of one of the arteries to the kidneys.The amount of salt in the diet and medications, such as over-the-counter pain relievers of the non-steroid class (such as Motrin and Advil), diuretics (water pills), beta blockers, steroids, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and oral contraceptives can affect the test results. You should ask your patient to stop taking some of his medicines for 2 weeks before the test.Screening test:Random plasma aldosterone/plasma renin activity (PRA) ratio - Because this ratio is fairly constant over many physiologic conditions, it can be used as a screening test. Normal values are less than 270 when aldosterone concentration is expressed in pmol/L, or are less than 10 when aldosterone concentration is expressed in ng/dL.Confirmatory test:The 24-hour urinary aldosterone (U-Aldo) excretion test is one of the most useful confirmatory diagnostic tools.

Some people with psychosis have false beliefs that can best be described as fearfulness and suspiciousness (paranoia). They may have vague fears or complaints about others controlling their lives, but many describe consistent suspicions of very specific, elaborate, and persistent plots against them. Very often, these beliefs are directed at family members or friends. For example, people with psychosis may believe that their spouse or children have deserted them or that their family or friends are scheming to obtain control of their finances or property.Hallucinationsseeing or hearing things that no one else sees or hearsare sometimes experienced by people with psychosis. These hallucinations may seem dangerous and threatening to the person, although in some cases they are taken in stride.People with psychosis may lose the ability to take care of their personal hygiene. They may seem withdrawn and without any emotions. However, when a psychotic disorder, such as paraphrenia, develops during old age, it is common for a person to communicate and function quite well despite delusions or hallucinations.",,

",Aphthous ulcers,Adenocarcinoma,Keloids,Oral leukoplakia,Epidermolysis bullosa,,4,"Leukoplakia is a condition in which thickened, white patches form on your gums, on the inside of your cheeks and sometimes on your tongue. These patches can't easily be scraped off.Leukoplakia is the most common of all chronic mouth lesions. Although anyone can develop leukoplakia, it's most common in older men. People with compromised immune systems sometimes develop an unusual form of the disorder called hairy leukoplakia.The cause of leukoplakia is unknown. Many possible causes have been linked to leukoplakia, including tobacco, long-term alcohol use and other chronic irritants. Though mechanical irritants, such as rough fillings or dentures, were once felt to be a cause of leukoplakia, they're no longer believed to lead to this condition.Tobacco use appears to be responsible for most cases of leukoplakia. The vast majority of people who develop leukoplakia are smokers, and most leukoplakic patches either improve or disappear within a year after stopping smoking. Chewing tobacco and snuff also play a key role, as many as three out of four regular users of &quot;smokeless tobacco&quot; products eventually develop leukoplakia where they hold the tobacco against their cheeks.",,

Which one of the following is the likely cause?  ",Delusional disorder,Paranoid schizophrenia,Anxiety disorder,Antisocial personality disorder,Schizoid personality disorder,,1,"Delusional Disorder is relatively uncommon in clinical settings, with most studies suggesting that the disorder accounts for 1%-2% of admissions to inpatient mental health facilities.The essential feature of Delusional Disorder is the presence of one or more nonbizarre delusions that persist for at least 1 month . Auditory or visual hallucinations, if present, are not prominent. Tactile or olfactory hallucinations may be present (and prominent) if they are related to the delusional theme Apart from the direct impact of the delusions, psychosocial functioning is not markedly impaired, and behavior is neither obviously odd nor bizarre. If mood episodes occur concurrently with the delusions, the total duration of these mood episodes is relatively brief compared to the total duration of the delusional periods. The delusions are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., cocaine) or a general medical condition (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus).Psychosocial functioning is variable. Some individuals may appear to be relatively unimpaired in their interpersonal and occupational roles. In others, the impairment may be substantial and include low or absent occupational functioning and social isolation. When poor psychosocial functioning is present in Delusional Disorder, it arises directly from the delusional beliefs themselves.",,

Risk factors for birth trauma include the use of instrumentation (i.e. forceps, vacuum), large for gestational age babies (&gt;4500 grams), macrocephaly, vaginal breech delivery, prolonged labor, prima gravidity, and excessive force or traction during delivery. Maternal diabetes is a known cause of babies that are born large for gestational age.Cephalohematoma is a subperiosteal hemorrhage. Because the bleeding is subperiosteal, the hematoma will be confined by the suture lines where the periosteum is bound tightly to the bone. Cephalohematomas are gradually resorbed and may take from two weeks to three months to resolve completely.",,
769,2,OBGYN,A 28 year old woman is currently 10 weeks pregnant. She is HBsAg positive and is concerned about the risk of transmission to the baby. Which one of the following is the most appropriate course to follow?  ,Immediate termination of pregnancy,Avoid breast-feeding,Cesarean section at term,Administer Hepatitis B vaccine to the baby at birth,Administer hepatitis B immune globulin followed by hepatitis B vaccine at birth,,5,"Newborns who are exposed to hepatitis B have more than a 90% chance of becoming chronically infected. This means the virus stays in their blood and liver for possibly a lifetime. They can pass the virus on to others. They will also live with a greater chance of developing liver failure or liver cancer later in life.It is most important that the newborn receive the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine in the delivery room. If possible, also give the hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG), which is another medication that helps the vaccine to work even more successfully. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), it is safe for an infected woman to breastfeed her child.",,

The attack rate of hepatitis A in this classroom is  ",25%,30%,35%,40%,45%,,4,"An attack rate in epidemiology is the cumulative incidence of infection in a group of people observed over a period of time during an epidemic, usually in relation to foodborne illness.The term is defined as the number of exposed persons infected with the disease divided by the total number of exposed persons.In this question the attack rate is (5+3+2)/25 = 40%",,
771,4,Pediatrics,A 9 year old boy has been referred to you for evaluation of bedwetting. He is dry during the day but wets every night. His physical examination and urinalysis are normal. Which one of the following is the most appropriate method for managing this child? ,Psychiatric counseling,Desmopressin (DDAVP),Waking at night,Nightly diapers,Limitation of fluid intake,,5,"Nocturnal enuresis is urinary incontinence during sleep. The child is counseled about the etiology and prognosis of enuresis, the aim of which is to remove blame and guilt. The child assumes an active role, including talking to the physician, urinating before going to bed, recording wet and dry nights, and changing wet clothing and bedding himself. The child should not consume fluids during the 2 to 3 hours before bedtime, and caffeinated beverages should be strictly limited. Positive reinforcement is given for dry nights (eg, a star calendar, other age-appropriate rewards).In addition to counseling, enuresis alarms are effective and often recommended simultaneously. Drug therapy can be effective in patients unresponsive to counseling and alarms. Short-term treatment (4 to 6 weeks) with desmopressin acetate nasal spray (a synthetic analog of ADH) is typically used in patients  6 years with persistent, frequent nocturnal enuresis.",,
772,4,Pediatrics,A 14 year old boy is referred with a blood pressure of 145/80 mmHg. There is family history of essential hypertension. His general physical examination and urinalysis are normal. Home blood pressure readings are consistently between 100-110 mmHg systolic and 70-80 mmHg diastolic. Which one of the following is the most likely cause of his hypertension? ,&quot;White coat&quot; hypertension,Essential hypertension,Reflux nephropathy,Pheochromocytoma,Renovascular hypertension,,1,"White coat hypertension is a phenomenon in which patients exhibit elevated blood pressure in a clinical setting but not when recorded by themselves at home. It is believed that this is due to the anxiety some people experience during a clinic visit and see a physican in a &lsquo;white coat'.As the notion of &quot;normal&quot; is subjective and changes from individual to individual a reference measurement was necessary. As night-time and self measured values are often not subject to daily stress and clinical values are subject to unusual anxiety, daytime ambulatory blood pressure is used as a reference as it takes into account daily stress but not in excess. Due to specificity involved in diagnosis of white coat hypertension, many problems have been incurred in its diagnosis and treatment.",,
773,4,Pediatrics,"A 3 year old boy, known to have sickle cell anemia, presents to the emergency room with sudden onset of severe pallor. Clinical examination reveals massive splenomegaly. On an earlier clinic visit 2 weeks before this boy had splenomegaly of only 2 cm. Which one of the following is the most likely explanation for this acute deterioration? ",Hemolysis,Malaria,Hemangioma,Folate deficiency,Sequestration,,5,"The spleen filters out abnormal red blood cells and helps the body's immune system fight infection. Sometimes, as in the case of sickle cell disease, red blood cells can be trapped in the spleen, a condition known as splenic sequestration. The body reacts as if it were bleeding internally because the blood trapped in the spleen cannot circulate to the heart or brain. This condition can range from mild to life threatening, depending on how much of the body's red blood cells are sequestered.When red blood cells are trapped, the spleen grows tender and becomes enlarged enough to feel in the upper left part of the abdomen. Doctors detect splenic sequestration by feeling for this enlarged spleen and testing for low red-blood cell counts. The child will look pale. In darker-skinned people, this may be easier to detect by looking at the lips, the inner eyelids, and the fingernail beds. Usually these areas are red or dark pink, but if they look light pink or white, then the child is pale.",,
774,2,OBGYN,"A patient has episodes of pain associated with menstrual periods. Following appropriate investigations, you diagnose endometriosis. Which one of the following is the most common pelvic site? ",Posterior cul-de-sac,Broad ligament of the uterus,Bladder,Ovary,Rectosigmoid colon,,4,"Endometriosis is a noncancerous disorder in which functioning endometrial tissue is implanted outside the uterine cavity. Symptoms depend on location of the implants and may include dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, infertility, dysuria, and pain during defecation. Endometriosis is commonly found in the cul-de-sac and in other peritoneal structures such as bladder and ovaries resulting in pelvic pain and infertility.If we accept the theory that retrograde menstruation is in large part responsible for the initiation of endometriosis in those women susceptible to the implantation of the endometrial cells, then the number one reason is the position of the ovary. The ovaries are adjacent to the opening of the tube in the pelvic area and that location alone will make the ovaries more prone to be contaminated with the regurgitated menstrual flow.Diagnosis is by biopsy, usually via laparoscopy. Treatments include anti-inflammatory drugs, drugs to suppress ovarian function and endometrial tissue growth, surgical ablation and excision of endometriotic implants, and, if disease is severe and no childbearing is planned, hysterectomy plus oophorectomy.",,

",Recombinant human anti-tetanus toxin,Metronidazole,Vaccination with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids,Intramuscular immunoglobulin,No further immunizations are required,tetanusprophylxkids.jpg,5,"There are four combination vaccines used to prevent diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis: DTaP, Tdap, DT, and Td. Two of these (DTaP and DT) are given to children younger than 7 years of age, and two (Tdap and Td) are given to older children and adults.Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15-18 months and 4-6 years. DT does not contain pertussis, and is used as a substitute for DTaP for children who cannot tolerate pertussis vaccine.Td is a tetanus-diphtheria vaccine given to adolescents and adults as a booster shot every 10 years, or after an exposure to tetanus under some circumstances. Tdap is similar to Td but also containing protection against pertussis. A single dose of Tdap is recommended for adolescents 11 or 12 years of age, or in place of one Td booster in older adolescents and adults age 19 through 64.",,

",Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis,Membranous glomerulonephritis,Polyarteritis nodosa,Schonlein-Henoch purpura,Drug-induced interstitial nephritis,,5,"Drug-induced interstitial nephritis (DIN) is characterized by a sudden impairment of renal function and is mainly a result of an immune-mediated reaction after intake of a drug. Many different drugs, such as antibiotics, anticonvulsants, diuretics, proton pump inhibitors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and many others, are known to cause DIN. The clinical manifestations are characterized by arthralgias, macular or maculopapular exanthema and fever, together with mild proteinuria, sterile pyuria, and eosinophilia. In many cases the only sign is an asymptomatic increase in serum creatinine. The diagnosis of DIN is confirmed with certainty only by biopsy. The mainstay of treatment is drug discontinuation; the role of steroids is controversial.",,

",Antibodies have been formed,A cell mediated response is responsible,This is a type I allergic response,Antibodies are directed against skin basement membrane,The antigen is bound to a cell surface protein,,2,"Type IV reactions (delayed hypersensitivity) are T cellmediated. These cells, sensitized after contact with a specific antigen, are activated by reexposure to the antigen; they damage tissue by direct toxic effects or through release of cytokines, which activate eosinophils, monocytes and macrophages, neutrophils, or killer cells depending on type.Disorders involving type IV reactions include contact dermatitis (eg, poison ivy), hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allograft rejection, tuberculosis, and many forms of drug hypersensitivity.",,
782,4,Pediatrics,A 7 year old girl has a blood pressure of 130/90 mmHg. She has had recurrent urinary tract infections in the past. She has proteinuria. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate investigation? ,Renal ultrasound,Renal scan,Plasma renin activity,Computerized tomography of abdomen,Digital angiography of renal vessels,,1,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections encountered by primary care physicians. Although UTIs do not occur with as great a frequency in children as in adults, they can be a source of significant morbidity in children. For reasons that are not yet completely understood, a minority of UTIs in children progress to renal scarring, hypertension and renal insufficiency. The diagnostic work-up should be tailored to uncover functional and structural abnormalities such as dysfunctional voiding, vesicoureteral reflux and obstructive uropathy. A more aggressive work-up, including renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrography, is recommended for patients at greater risk for pyelonephritis and renal scarring, including infants less than one year of age and all children who have systemic signs of infection concomitant with a UTI.",,
783,4,Pediatrics,"A 2 year old child, who was previously well, presents with a sudden onset of cough, respiratory distress and wheeze. Examination reveals that he is afebrile with diminished air entry and wheezing on the right side. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ",Acute asthma,Acute pneumothorax,Congenital lung cyst,Foreign body inhalation,Bronchitis,,4,"Because many patients who have swallowed foreign bodies are asymptomatic, physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion. An estimated 40 percent of foreign body ingestions in children are not witnessed, and in many cases, the child never develops symptoms.Objects that have passed the esophagus generally do not cause symptoms unless complications, such as bowel perforation or obstruction, occur. Patients with objects lodged in the esophagus may be asymptomatic or may present with symptoms varying from vomiting, coughing or refractory wheezing to generalized irritability and behavioral disturbances.Longstanding esophageal foreign bodies may cause failure to thrive or recurrent aspiration pneumonia. Esophageal perforation may result in neck swelling, crepitations, and pneumomediastinum. Common sites for obstruction by an ingested foreign body include the cricopharyngeal area, middle one third of the esophagus, lower esophageal sphincter, pylorus, and ileocecal valve.",,
784,2,OBGYN,"A female patient is a newcomer to the country. She is single and in labor. She has had no prenatal care. You decide to give her anti-Rh Ig (RhoGam) to prevent which one of the following, in subsequent pregnancies ",Immunodeficiency,Neonatal lupus,Hemolytic disease of the newborn,T cell immune deficiency syndrome,Transient hypogammaglobulinemia,,3,"Hemolytic disease of the newborn (also called erythroblastosis fetalis) is a condition in which red blood cells are broken down or destroyed more rapidly than is normal. The newborn's red blood cells are destroyed by antibodies that were produced by the mother and crossed the placenta from the mother's circulation into the fetal circulation before delivery. A mother who is Rh-negative may have produced antibodies against Rh-positive blood cells after she was exposed to red blood cells of a previous fetus that was Rh-positive. Such exposure may occur during pregnancy or labor, but may also occur if the mother had been accidentally transfused with Rh-positive blood at any time earlier in life. The mother's body responds to the &ldquo;incompatible blood&rdquo; by producing antibodies to destroy the &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; Rh-positive cells. These antibodies cross the placenta during a subsequent pregnancy. If the fetus she is carrying is Rh-negative, there is no consequence. However, if the fetus has Rh-positive red blood cells, the mother's antibodies attach to, and start to destroy, the fetal red blood cells, leading to anemia of varying degrees. This anemia begins in the fetus and continues after delivery. Prevention of hemolytic disease due to Rh incompatibility involves injecting the mother with a Rh0(D) immune globulin preparation at about 28 weeks of pregnancy and again immediately after delivery. Injection of this immune globulin rapidly destroys any Rh-positive fetal red blood cells that have entered the mother's circulation before they stimulate the mother's body to produce antibodies.",,

Abscesses usually originate in an anal crypt. These abscesses can be very painful; perianal swelling, redness, and tenderness are characteristic. Deeper abscesses may be less painful but cause toxic symptoms (eg, fever, chills, malaise). There may be no perianal findings, but digital rectal examination may reveal a tender, fluctuant swelling of the rectal wall. High pelvirectal abscesses may cause lower abdominal pain and fever without rectal symptoms. Sometimes fever is the only symptom.Diagnosis is primarily by examination and CT scan or pelvic MRI for deeper abscesses. Treatment is surgical drainage.",,

This is something brought on by infection after, for example, appendicitis, a burst ulcer, or an operation. The abscess is a pool of half a pint (250 ml) or more of liquid pus. It can cause fever. Commonly these abscesses only show up two or more weeks after the infection. Also they often need to be left even longer than this before they are 'ripe' enough to be opened up and drained safely. The abscess can form high up under the ribs, or deep down in the pelvis, or anywhere in between.",,

Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ,Sinus histiocytosis,Metastatic carcinoma,Hodgkin's disease,Sarcoidosis,Angiosarcoma,,2,"Metastatic cancer invades locally and spreads initially through the regional lymph nodes, bloodstream, or both. In women metastatic breast cancer may affect almost any organ in the body&mdash;most commonly, lungs, liver, bone, brain, and skin. Most skin metastases occur in the region of the breast surgery; scalp metastases also are common. Metastatic breast cancer frequently appears years or decades after initial diagnosis and treatment.Estrogen and progesterone receptors, present in some breast cancers, are nuclear hormone receptors that promote DNA replication and cell division when they are bound to the appropriate hormones. Thus, drugs that block these receptors may be useful in treating tumors with the receptors. About 2&frasl;3 of postmenopausal patients have an estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) tumor. Incidence of ER+ tumors is lower among premenopausal patients. Matted or fixed axillary lymph nodes suggest tumor spread, as does supraclavicular or infraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Inflammatory breast cancer is characterized by diffuse inflammation and enlargement of the breast, often without a lump, and has a particularly aggressive course.",,

Bronchoscopy and biopsy reveal small cell carcinoma. All staging investigations are normal, suggesting disease is confined to the lung. Which one of the following treatment strategies is most appropriate? ",Left pneumonectomy,Pre-operative radiation therapy followed by pneumonectomy,Radiation therapy to the chest,Chemotherapy followed by left pneumonectomy,Chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the chest,,5,"Lung carcinoma is a malignant lung tumor usually categorized as small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Cigarette smoking is the major risk factor for most types. Symptoms include cough, chest discomfort, and, less commonly, hemoptysis, but many patients are asymptomatic and some present with metastatic disease. Diagnosis is suspected by chest x-ray or CT scan and confirmed by biopsy. SCLC of any stage is typically initially responsive to treatment, but responses are usually short-lived. Surgery generally plays no role in treatment of SCLC, although it may be curative in the rare patient who has a small focal tumor without spread (such as a solitary pulmonary nodule).In limited-stage disease, a combination of chemotherapy drugs in 4 to 6 cycles is thought to be most effective. Radiation further improves response; the very definition of limited-stage disease as disease confined to a hemithorax is based on the significant improvement in survival observed with radiation.",,
797,1,Medicine,Which one of the following is the best indicator of adequate control in a patient with diabetes mellitus? ,Fasting blood glucose,24-hour glycosuria,Blood glucose 2 hours after meals,Glycosylated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1C),Urine free of glucose,,4,"In the normal 120-day life span of the red blood cell, glucose molecules join hemoglobin, forming glycated hemoglobin. In individuals with poorly controlled diabetes, increases in the quantities of these glycated hemoglobins are noted.Once a hemoglobin molecule is glycated, it remains that way. A buildup of glycated hemoglobin within the red cell reflects the average level of glucose to which the cell has been exposed during its life cycle. Measuring glycated hemoglobin assesses the effectiveness of therapy by monitoring long-term serum glucose regulation. The International Diabetes Federation recommend HbA1c values below 6.5%, while the American Diabetes Association recommends that the HbA1c be below 7.0% for most patients. A high HbA1c represents poor glucose control. Persistent elevations in blood sugar (and therefore HbA1c) increase the risk for the long-term vascular complications of diabetes such as coronary disease, heart attack, stroke, heart failure, kidney failure, blindness, erectile dysfunction, neuropathy (loss of sensation, especially in the feet), gangrene, and gastroparesis (slowed emptying of the stomach).",,

The tendons involved are responsible for anchoring the muscles that extend or lift the wrist and hand. Patients often complain of severe, burning pain on the outside part of the elbow. In most cases, the pain starts in a mild and slow fashion. It gradually worsens over weeks or months. The pain can be made worse by pressing on the outside part of the elbow or by gripping or lifting objects. The doctor will perform a physical examination. The doctor may press directly on the bony prominence on the outside part of the elbow to see if it causes pain. The doctor may also ask the patient to lift the wrist or fingers against pressure to see if that causes pain.",,

801,5,Psychiatry,"An elderly woman is admitted to a psychiatric unit for workup of possible depression. Her symptoms consist primarily of lethargy and indifference. She appears to ignore the left side of her body in her daily activities, and when questioned about this, she denies any difficulties. This patient should be suspected of having a ",Bilateral frontal lobe lesion,Right parietal lobe lesion,Right temporal lobe lesion,Left pontine lesion,Left cerebellar lesion,q725.jpg,2,"The parietal lobes can be divided into two functional regions. One involves sensation and perception and the other is concerned with integrating sensory input, primarily with the visual system. The first function integrates sensory information to form a single perception (cognition). The second function constructs a spatial coordinate system to represent the world around us. Individuals with damage to the parietal lobes often show striking deficits, such as abnormalities in body image and spatial relations.Damage to the left parietal lobe can result in what is called &quot;Gerstmann's Syndrome.&quot; It includes right-left confusion, difficulty with writing (agraphia) and difficulty with mathematics (acalculia). It can also produce disorders of language (aphasia) and the inability to perceive objects normally (agnosia).Damage to the right parietal lobe can result in neglecting part of the body or space (contralateral neglect), which can impair many self-care skills such as dressing and washing. Right side damage can also cause difficulty in making things (constructional apraxia), denial of deficits (anosagnosia) and drawing ability.",,

",Tuberous sclerosis,Sturge-Weber disease,Neurofibromatosis,Ataxia telangiectasia,Von Hippel-Lindau disease,,3,"Neurofibromatosis is an autosomal dominant disorder producing tumors along the course of nerves and occasionally resulting in marked soft tissue or bony deformity. Most patients are asymptomatic and identified during routine examination, examination for cosmetic complaints, or when evaluating a positive family history. Some present with neurologic symptoms or bony abnormalities. In  90%, characteristic skin lesions are apparent at birth or develop during infancy. Lesions are medium-brown (caf-au-lait), freckle-like macules, distributed most commonly over the trunk, pelvis, and flexor creases of elbows and knees. During late childhood, flesh-colored cutaneous tumors of various sizes and shapes appear, ranging in number from several to thousands. Neurologic symptoms are varied but relate to location and number of neurofibromas.

807,2,OBGYN,A young woman with phenylketonuria (PKU) has not been following her diet over the past several years. She comes to you in her first trimester of pregnancy. Which one of the following congenital abnormalities would the baby most likely develop? ,Neurological,Renal,Musculoskeletal,Respiratory,Visual,,1,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is necessary to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine to the amino acid tyrosine. When it is deficient, phenylalanine accumulates and is converted into phenylketones, which are detected in the urine.Left untreated, this condition can cause problems with brain development, leading to progressive mental retardation and seizures. However, PKU is one of the few genetic diseases that can be controlled by diet. A diet low in phenylalanine and high in tyrosine can be a very effective treatment. There is no cure. Damage done is irreversible so early detection is crucial.For women affected with PKU, it is essential for the health of their child to maintain low phenylalanine levels before and during pregnancy. Though the developing fetus may only be a carrier of the PKU gene, the intrauterine environment can have very high levels of phenylalanine, which can cross the placenta. The result is that the child may develop congenital heart disease, growth retardation, microcephaly and mental retardation.",,

",Linear fracture of the vault of skull,Anterior cranial fossa fracture,Petrous bone fracture,Foramen magnum fracture,Squamous temporal bone fracture,,2,"Anterior cranial fossa fractures are associated with CSF rhinorrhea and bruising around the eyes, ie, raccoon eyes.Defects in the floor of the anterior cranial fossa can lead to the leakage of CSF into the nasal cavity. Because of the microbiologic nature of the nasal cavity and its continuity with the rest of the upper aerodigestive tract, communication with the intracranial contents can lead to meningitis and other intracranial complications, including serious and sometimes lethal medical problems.With increased performance of endoscopic procedures of the anterior skull base and given the nature of trauma to this area, the number of patients with CSF rhinorrhea has increased.",,
812,6,Surgery,"A 20 year old man falls onto his outstretched left hand. On examination, there is pain on deep palpation at the base of the thumb. Which one of the following bones is most likely fractured? ",Lunate,Pisiform,Scaphoid,Hamate,Trapezium,,3,"A fall on an outstretched arm often results in a fracture of the scaphoid (navicular) bone in the wrist. This small bone is one of 8 carpal bones in the wrist. The scaphoid sits below the thumb, and is shaped like a kidney bean. This complex bone has a unique and limited blood supply that can be easily disrupted by a fracture. If there is pain or deep aching on the thumb-side of the wrist, typically after a fall on an outstretched arm, the patient likely has a scaphoid fracture.Other symptoms include swelling in the wrist, difficulty gripping objects, and tenderness or pain in the anatomical snuff box (a sunken space between tendons of the wrist). Many patients are diagnosed with a wrist sprain, when they actually have a fracture. Diagnosis is difficult because the fracture often doesn't appear on x-rays until weeks later, after healing has begun. Because of this, it is common for physicians to treat a wrist injury as though it were a scaphoid fracture initially, and then repeat x-rays within two weeks.",,

Which one of the following is the best management strategy? ",Repeat the triple therapy,Perform endoscopy,Repeat serology in three months,Test his spouse for H. pylori,Reassure and counsel,,5,"H. pylori is a common gastric pathogen that causes gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, and low-grade gastric lymphoma. Infection may be asymptomatic or result in varying degrees of dyspepsia. Diagnosis is by urea breath test and testing of endoscopic biopsy samples. Laboratory and office-based serologic assays for antibodies to H. pylori have sensitivity and specificity of  85% and are considered the noninvasive tests of choice for initial documentation of H. pylori infection. However, because qualitative assays remain positive for up to 3 years after successful treatment and because quantitative antibody levels do not decline significantly for 6 to 12 months after treatment, serologic assays are not usually used to assess cure.",,
814,6,Surgery,A 65 year old woman is prescribed tamoxifen therapy following surgery for breast cancer. Which one of the following best describes the mode of action of this drug on reducing the patient's risk of recurrent disease? ,It has progestational activity that limits the growth-promoting effects of estrogens,It decreases secretion of follicle-stimulating hormones (FSH),It enhances biliary excretion of estrogens,It blocks the binding of estrogen to estrogen receptors,It has direct cytotoxic effects,,4,"The majority of breast and uterine cancers are estrogen receptor positive, indicating that these cancers may be stimulated or maintained by estrogen. Fortunately, growth in estrogen receptor positive cancers may be halted by a number of agents, such as Tamoxifen as well as many other drugs that have been developed in recent years. Tamoxifen (Nolvadex) is part of a class of anti-cancer drugs known as selective estrogen receptor modulators, or SERMs. The drugs in this class, although all slightly different, block tumor growth by mimicking estrogen and filling up estrogen receptors which prevents the cancerous growth. Estrogens themselves have good effects in the body, but tend to &quot;feed&quot; breast and uterine cancers as well as increase the risk for blood clots. Ideally, the perfect drug would have all of the good effects without any of the bad, but to date, no one drug alone does this. Tamoxifen blocks estrogen receptors in the breast, but mimics estrogen in the uterus, which may increase the risk for uterine cancer.",,
815,1,Medicine,"A 74 year old female is brought to the emergency room. She is unresponsive and restless. Her breathing is laboured.

817,1,Medicine,A 35 year old epileptic presents to your office complaining of a fuzzy feeling in the head. Examination shows bidirectional horizontal nystagmus. The most likely cause of this finding is: ,Poorly controlled epilepsy,Vitamin B12 deficiency,Alcoholism,Phenytoin excess,Subdural hematoma,,4,"Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant drug which can be useful in the treatment of epilepsy. The primary site of action appears to be the motor cortex where spread of seizure activity is inhibited. Possibly by promoting sodium efflux from neurons, phenytoin tends to stabilize the threshold against hyperexcitability caused by excessive stimulation or environmental changes capable of reducing membrane sodium gradient. Phenytoin reduces the maximal activity of brain stem centers responsible for the tonic phase of tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures. The most common manifestations encountered with phenytoin excess include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination and mental confusion. Dizziness, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, and headaches have also been observed.",,

The syndrome may be central, preganglionic, or postganglionic in origin; it may be primary or secondary to another disorder. An apical bronchogenic carcinoma (eg Pancoast tumor) is the most common cause of Horner syndrome.Central lesions include brain stem ischemia, syringomyelia, and brain tumor; peripheral lesions include Pancoast tumor, thyrocervical venous dilatation, cervical adenopathy, neck and skull injuries, aortic or carotid dissection, and thoracic aortic aneurysm. A congenital form exists.Symptoms include ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis, and hyperemia of the affected side. In the congenital form, the iris does not become pigmented and remains blue-gray. Liquid cocaine 10% can be applied to the affected eye; poor pupillary dilation after 30 min indicates Horner's syndrome. If results are positive, 1% hydroxyamphetamine solution or 5% n-methyl hydroxyamphetamine can be applied to the eye 48 h later to determine whether the lesion is preganglionic (if the pupil dilates) or postganglionic (if the pupil does not dilate).",,

Delirium tremens usually does not begin immediately; rather, it appears about 2 to 10 days after the drinking stops. In delirium tremens, the person is initially anxious and later develops increasing confusion, sleeplessness, nightmares, excessive sweating, and profound depression. The pulse rate tends to speed up. Fever typically develops. The episode may escalate to include fleeting hallucinations, illusions that arouse fear and restlessness, and disorientation with visual hallucinations that may incite terror. Objects seen in dim light may be particularly terrifying, and the person becomes extremely confused. The floor may seem to move, the walls fall, or the room rotates. As the delirium progresses, the hands develop a persistent tremor that sometimes extends to the head and body, and most people become severely uncoordinated.

With sufficient compression, the cuff cuts off blood flow through the artery, and no sound is heard in the stethoscope. The pressure in the cuff is increased rapidly to 30 millimeters of mercury above the point that no blood flow is taking place through the cuff when no sound can be heard in the stethoscope or when a pulse can no longer be felt in the wrist.Then valve is loosened in the bulb and to lessen the air pressure. Pressure is then decreased so that the rate of drop is 2 millimeters per second. When the pressure falls to the point that blood begins to flow through the artery again, the number that the column of mercury has risen to at the first sound heard in the stethoscope is the systolic blood pressure (SBP), the first number in the blood pressure readingLook at the column of mercury to see the number at that pressure point. When the cuff decompresses to the point that blood flows freely in the artery, the sound is no longer heard in the stethoscope. The number next to the top of the column of mercury when the sound ceases is the diastolic blood pressure (DBP), the second number in the blood pressure reading. Again, look at the column of mercury to see the number at that pressure point. Record the SBP and the DBP numbers immediately (don't depend on memory), and note the arm (right or left) used for taking the measurement is noted.",,

",Tomography,Computed tomography scan of chest,Tuberculin skin test,Pulmonary function test,Bronchoscopy,,3,"Tuberculosis (TB) infection usually occurs initially in the upper part (lobe) of the lungs. The body's immune system, however, can stop the bacteria from continuing to reproduce. Thus, the immune system can make the lung infection inactive (dormant). On the other hand, if the body's immune system cannot contain the TB bacteria, the bacteria will reproduce (become active or reactivate) in the lungs and spread elsewhere in the body.It may take many months from the time the infection initially gets into the lungs until symptoms develop. The usual symptoms that occur with an active TB infection are a generalized tiredness or weakness, weight loss, fever, and night sweats. If the infection in the lung worsens, then further symptoms can include coughing, chest pain, coughing up of sputum (material from the lungs) and/or blood, and shortness of breath. If the infection spreads beyond the lungs, the symptoms will depend upon the organs involved.TB can be diagnosed in several different ways, including chest x-rays, analysis of sputum, and skin tests. Sometimes, the chest x-rays can reveal evidence of active tuberculosis pneumonia. Other times, the x-rays may show scarring (fibrosis) or hardening (calcification) in the lungs, suggesting that the TB is contained and inactive. Several types of skin tests are used to screen for TB infection. These so-called tuberculin skin tests include the Tine test and the Mantoux test, also known as the PPD (purified protein derivative) test. In each of these tests, a small amount of purified extract from dead tuberculosis bacteria is injected under the skin. If a person is infected with tuberculosis, a raised and reddened area will occur around the site of the test injection.",,
825,1,Medicine,"An 18 year old male presents with a 2-week history of cough, headache, malaise, and fever. Physical examination shows a patient in good general condition with no abnormal findings on auscultation. Gram stain of the sputum is negative and the white blood cell count is normal. Chest x-ray shows bilateral pneumonia in the lower lobes without pleural effusion. Which one of the following is the most likely cause? ",Haemophilus influenzae,Staphylococcus aureus,Mycoplasma pneumoniae,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Streptococcus pneumoniae,,3,"Walking pneumonia (a.k.a. mycoplasma pneumonia or atypical pneumonia) is a term used to describe a mild case of pneumonia. It is a lung infection that is caused by the mycoplasma pneumoniae organism. Walking pneumonia is different from other types of pneumonia in that, even if untreated, walking pneumonia would not cause a person to be confined to a bed or require a hospital stay.Signs and symptoms of walking pneumonia usually include a severe cough, fever, abdominal pain, headaches, and chills. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, the organism that causes walking pneumonia, can be contagious if contact with the infected person is prolonged.Walking pneumonia is transmitted through airborne droplets, which are dispersed when a person talks, sneezes, coughs or laughs. The onset of walking pneumonia takes approximately 1 to 3 weeks, beginning gradually, with the earliest sign being a decrease in energy. Soon thereafter, cold-like symptoms begin. You will be able to distinguish the difference between walking pneumonia and a common cold because walking pneumonia will get worse over 2 weeks.",,
826,1,Medicine,A patient with chronic renal failure is being treated with furosemide for edema on a long term basis. Which one of the following is the most common adverse effect? ,Depression,Hypokalemia,Metabolic acidosis,Hypervolemia,Bradycardia,,2,"Furosemide is a powerful diuretic. Furosemide is used to treat excessive fluid accumulation and swelling (edema) of the body caused by heart failure, cirrhosis, chronic kidney failure, and nephrotic syndrome. It is sometimes used in conjunction with other blood pressure pills to treat high blood pressure. Commonly observed side effects are low blood pressure, and water and electrolyte depletion. Furosemide can cause lowering of blood potassium, sodium, and magnesium levels. Low potassium and magnesium levels can lead to heart rhythm abnormalities. Thiazide diuretics (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide) and loop diuretics (e.g. furosemide) are a common cause of hypokalemia. ",,

In this condition, the lungs are no longer able to provide the body with adequate oxygen or adequately remove carbon dioxide. Without oxygen, many organs begin to malfunction. The buildup of carbon dioxide leads to acidosis, an acidic state of the blood that affects the function of almost every organ. Blood pressure may fall to low levels. The airways are so narrowed that it is difficult to move air in and out of the lungs.Patients who have status asthmaticus receive a beta-adrenergic agonist and corticosteroids. Status asthmaticus may also require intubation and ventilator support.",,
830,5,Psychiatry,"A previously-healthy 70 year old man made a nearly successful attempt at suicide by hanging. His depression has been effectively treated with a tricyclic antidepressant. On examination, he has an impairment of short and long-term memory. He is well-nourished, and routine hematologic and biochemical tests are normal. The most likely cause of his memory deficit is  ",Psychogenic amnesia,Alzheimer disease,Posttraumatic stress disorder,Cerebral anoxia,Thiamine deficiency,,4,"Hanging or strangulation account for 15% of all suicides yearly with hanging being the most common method of suicide amongst inmates. The male to female ratio is 4:1. Death is caused by cerebral anoxia caused by compression of the nerves and vessels in the neck. Occlusion of the upper airway by constriction of the neck is thought to be rare, however closure of the airway is caused by upward displacement of the tongue and epiglottis. Cardiac arrest may ensue from pressure on the vagus nerve or carotid sinus.Most survivors of the initial trauma later die of pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia, or ARDS. Delayed airway obstruction has been observed secondary to hemorrhage or edema formation or to fracture of the hyoid bone. Survivors often exhibit memory loss, restlessness, and confusion.",,
831,1,Medicine,A 20 year old man is referred for assessment of proteinuria found on an insurance examination. The history is unrevealing. Physical examination is normal. Urinalysis (urine microscopy) shows 1-2+ proteinuria by dipstick and is otherwise unremarkable. Urea nitrogen is 5.4 mmol/L (Normal 2.5-8.0 mmol/L) and serum creatinine is 88.4 mol/L (Normal 70-120 mol/L). Which one of the following would be the correct management?  ,"Determination of 24-hour urine protein excretion, fractionated into supine and upright samples",Reassurance and reassessment in 6 months,Intravenous pyelogram and cystoscopic examination,Admission to hospital for percutaneous renal biopsy,Determination of urine protein electrophoretic pattern,,1,"Proteinuria is protein, usually albumin, in urine. In many renal disorders, it occurs with other urinary abnormalities (eg, hematuria). Isolated proteinuria is urinary protein without other symptoms or abnormalities. Causes may be categorized as glomerular, tubular, overflow, or physiologic. Exercise proteinuria, sometimes with hematuria, hemoglobinuria, or myoglobinuria, is proteinuria of unknown cause that may occur in runners, boxers, and other people engaged in vigorous exercise.High concentrations of protein cause frothy or sudsy urine; patients, especially men, occasionally report this symptom. But diagnosis of proteinuria requires urinalysis; it is most often detected incidentally. History and physical examination occasionally give clues to cause.If urine dipstick assay detects proteinuria, it should be repeated 1 to 2 times; resolution suggests an initial false-positive result or a transient cause. Persistent proteinuria should be quantified with a 24-h urine collection, although calculation of a protein:creatinine ratio in a random sample may be sufficient. Nephrotic syndrome is defined as proteinuria  3.5 g/day.Microscopic analysis should be performed to detect casts, lipiduria, and other signs of glomerular disorders. Orthostatic proteinuria is diagnosed with a 24-h urine collection split between a 16-h upright daytime specimen (in which protein is present) and an 8-h recumbent nighttime specimen (in which protein should be  50 mg).",,

Immediate management includes all of the following, except: ",Drying all the exposed skin,Clearance of airway,Intravenous sodium bicarbonate,Administration of naloxone 0.01 mg/kg,Oxygen,,3,"Meperidine has been studied extensively in relation to the high incidence of neonatal respiratory depression in newborns whose mothers received low doses of this drug. Years of study have revealed that following intravenous maternal analgesia with meperidine there are fewer neonatal effects if delivery occurs within 1 hour of a single 25 to 50 mg dose. The fetal dose of meperidine increases for about 3 hours following maternal intramuscular administration.The toxic fetal metabolite normeperidine increases for many hours and contributes to neonatal depression. There is no longer any doubt that fetal metabolism contributes to the peripartal formation of normeperidine. Immediate management includes drying all the exposed skin, clearance of airway and oxygen.

836,4,Pediatrics,A 2 year old girl presents because of an apparently absent vagina. Examination reveals normal external genitalia except for a midline fusion. The most probable diagnosis is:  ,Turner syndrome,Congenital absence of the vagina,Adrenogenital syndrome,Imperforate hymen,Labial adhesions,,5,"Labial adhesion occurs in children when the inner vaginal lips (labia minora) fuse to each other. It often gives the appearance that the opening of the vagina has closed off. It may be noticed incidentally by a parent or by a physician during a medical examination, or the child may complain of irritation or difficulty urinating.Because the fusion sometimes creates a little pouch in front of the vagina where urine can collect, some children experience dribbling when they stand up after urinating. Occasionally a child will get a bladder infection or will have difficulty passing urine due to the obstruction but most often labial adhesions are not significant enough to obstruct the flow of urine.The most likely cause is that inflammation of the labia minora creates two raw surfaces at the edges of the lips, which eventually heal together in the middle, partly or fully covering the opening of the vagina.Many factors can lead to inflammation and irritation of the vaginal lips. Exposure to irritants like fabric softener residue, perfumed soaps, or bits of stool; or a prolonged exposure to damp (as in wet diapers) all can cause irritation of the area. The lack of estrogen (which is normal before puberty) probably plays a role in this process.",,
837,2,OBGYN,A 34 year old woman presents to the Emergency Department with a 6 hour history of intermittent severe crampy right lower quadrant pain. The patient is vomiting and is afebrile. There is a right adnexal tender mass on pelvic examination. The white blood cell count is 16 x 10^9/L per high power field; urinalysis is within normal limits; and the beta human chorionic gonadotropin (-HCG) is negative. The most probable diagnosis is:  ,Right pyelonephritis,Acute appendicitis,Right ovarian endometrioma,Acute salpingitis,Torsion of a right ovarian cyst,,5,"Adnexal torsion is uncommon, occurring most often during reproductive years. It usually indicates an ovarian abnormality. Risk factors include pregnancy, induction of ovulation, and ovarian enlargement to  4 cm (eg, particularly by benign tumors or hyperstimulation with fertility drugs). Torsion of normal adnexa, which is rare, is more common among children than adults.Torsion causes sudden severe pelvic pain and sometimes nausea and vomiting. For days or occasionally weeks before the sudden pain, intermittent, colicky pain may occur, presumably resulting from intermittent torsion that spontaneously resolves. Cervical motion tenderness, a unilateral tender adnexal mass, and peritoneal signs are usually present.Adnexal torsion is suspected based on typical symptoms and unexplained peritoneal signs plus severe cervical motion tenderness or an adnexal mass without evidence of pelvic inflammatory disease. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by color Doppler transvaginal ultrasonography. Immediate laparoscopy or laparotomy is done if torsion is suspected or confirmed by ultrasonography. Treatment aims to salvage the ovary and fallopian tube by untwisting them via laparoscopy or laparotomy. Salpingo-oophorectomy is required for nonviable tissue, which may not be necrotic yet.",,

",Childhood history of stammering,History of previous episodes of conversion disorder,History of recent stress,History of recent onset of sexual dysfunction,Family history of conversion disorder,,1,"Conversion disorder consists of symptoms or deficits that develop unconsciously and nonvolitionally and usually involve motor or sensory function. Manifestations resemble a neurologic or other general medical condition but rarely conform to known pathophysiologic mechanisms or anatomic pathways. Onset and maintenance of conversion symptoms are typically attributed to mental factors, such as stress. Diagnosis is based on history after excluding physical disorders. Treatment begins by establishing a consistent, supportive physician-patient relationship; psychotherapy can help, as may hypnosis or drug-facilitated interviews.",,

841,2,OBGYN,A 28 year old woman has a cervical cytologic smear report which revealed many severely dyskaryotic cells and a few frankly malignant cells. The next step in this patient's management should be: ,Colposcopy and biopsy,Cone biopsy,Repeat smear,Hysterectomy,Dilation and curettage,,1,"Cervical cytology testing (such as the Pap test) involves collecting a sample of cells from the cervix and examining them under a microscope. The sample is then sent to a laboratory, where it is examined under a microscope for abnormal cells, which may indicate precancerous changes or, rarely, cervical cancer. Colposcopy is often done if results of a Papanicolaou (Pap) test are abnormal. For colposcopy, a speculum is used to spread the walls of the vagina and a binocular magnifying lens (similar to that of a microscope) is used to inspect the cervix for signs of cancer. Often, a sample of tissue is removed for examination under a microscope (biopsy). A cervical biopsy is done when a condition likely to eventually lead to cancer (precancerous condition) or cancer is suspected, usually because a Pap test result was abnormal. A biopsy of the cervix or vagina is usually done during colposcopy. During colposcopy, doctors can identify the area that looks most abnormal and take tissue samples from it.",,
842,1,Medicine,"A 35 year old man with a recent history of severe multiple trauma is noted to have dyspnea and is diagnosed as having adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). All of the following statements about the management of ARDS are correct, except: ",Management may include artificial ventilation with endotracheal intubation and oxygen therapy,A sudden deterioration in a ventilated patient should raise the suspicion of pneumothorax,Early management may include oxygen by mask and careful monitoring of respiratory rate and arterial blood gases,Furosemide is routinely used to keep the lungs as dry as possible,Frequent arterial blood gas determinations will be required to assess the adequacy of therapy in any ventilated patient,,4,"People with ARDS are treated in an intensive care unit. Successful treatment depends on correcting the underlying cause; oxygen therapy, which is vital to correcting low oxygen levels, is combined with treatment of the underlying cause.If oxygen delivered by a face mask or nasal prongs does not correct the low blood oxygen levels, or if excessively high doses of inhaled oxygen are required, a ventilator must be used; this treatment is called mechanical ventilation. A ventilator delivers oxygen-rich air under pressure using a tube inserted through the mouth into the trachea. The pressure supplied by the ventilator during and after a breath opens collapsed (atelectatic) regions of the lung and allows oxygen to move through the walls of the injured lungs into the blood.The pressure and volume of air that the ventilator delivers to the lungs with each breath must be adjusted to help keep the small airways and alveoli open while avoiding rupturing the fragile air sacs, which can lead to air accumulating around the lung and collapsing it (called pneumothorax). Monitoring and adjusting the pressure also ensures that the lungs do not receive an excessive concentration of oxygen, which can damage the lungs and worsen ARDS. In some cases, diuretic drugs may be needed to help remove fluid from the lungs. Antibiotics are usually needed for people who develop bacterial pneumonia. Some people may benefit from the use of intravenous corticosteroids in the later stages of ARDS.",,

They usually have a delayed &quot;bone age,&quot; which means that their skeletal maturation is younger than their age in years. (A child's bone age is measured by taking an X-ray of a child's hand and wrist and comparing it to standard X-ray findings seen in children of the same age.) These children don't have any signs or symptoms of diseases that affect growth. They tend to reach puberty later than their peers do, with delay in the onset of sexual development and the pubertal growth spurt. But because they continue to grow until an older age, they tend to catch up to their peers when they reach adult height.

The child's diet must be evaluated. Fluid intake may play a factor. Studies have shown a link between excessive fluid consumption and toddlers diarrhea, as well as high carbohydrate, low fat diets. Excess fruit juice intake - especially apple juice - is often the cause of mysterious diarrhea (apple juice contains sorbitol, the &quot;active ingredient&quot; in prunes). If the child is being given any natural remedies or health foods, these need to be mentioned to the doctor and probably stopped to see if there is an improvement in the diarrhea. Treatment is mostly dietary manipulation. Carbohydrates, especially fruit juices, are reduced and fat increased to 35-40% of the total calories. High fiber foods such as beans, fruit, breads, and cereals should be encouraged.

This compression can cause many physical deformities of the fetus, most common of which is Potter facies. Lower extremity anomalies are frequent in these cases, which often presents with clubbed feet and/or bowing of the legs.",,

A severe or repeated attack of postalcoholic delirium tremens can trigger Korsakoff's psychosis whether or not a typical attack of Wernicke's encephalopathy has occurred first. Immediate memory is severely affected (best tested with '3 items for 5mins'); retrograde and anterograde amnesia occurs in varying degrees. Patients tend to draw on memory of remote events, which appears to be less affected than memory of recent events. Disorientation to time is common. Emotional changes are common; they include apathy, blandness, or mild euphoria with little or no response to events, even frightening ones. Spontaneity and initiative may be decreased.Confabulation is often a striking early feature; bewildered patients unconsciously fabricate imaginary or confused accounts of events they cannot recall; these fabrications may be so convincing that the underlying disorder is not detected.",,

In such cases, delivery by cesarean section is preferred. If visible lesions or prodrome is absent, even in women with recurrent infections, risk is low, and vaginal delivery is possible. If women are asymptomatic, serial antepartum cultures do not help identify those at risk of transmission. If women have recurrent herpes infections during pregnancy but no other risk factors for transmission, delivery can sometimes be induced to occur between recurrences. When delivery is vaginal, cervical and neonatal herpes virus cultures are done. Acyclovir (oral and topical) appears to be safe during pregnancy.",,

Adverse effects related specifically to the hormone-releasing IUD include amenorrhea, acne, depression, weight gain, decreased libido, and headache. If the IUD threads are ever not present, a pregnancy test should be performed. When the results are negative, a cytobrush can be inserted gently into the cervical canal to locate the threads. If this method is unsuccessful, radiography or ultrasonography may be used to locate the IUD. When the results of the pregnancy test are positive, an ectopic implantation must be ruled out. If the strings are visible and the pregnancy is early, the IUD can be removed but with a risk of pregnancy loss.

",Diarrhea,Pancreatitis,Polyuria,Abdominal pain,Gastritis,,1,"Nasogastric feeding is recommended for temporary feeding, usually for a period of less than 30 days. This procedure may be appropriate if dysphagia occurs abruptly after a short illness and the patient is expected to recover.Enteral feeding often leads to diarrhea, especially if bowel function is compromised by disease or drugs, particularly broad-spectrum antibiotics. Diarrhea may be controlled by the use of a continuous drip, with a fiber-containing formula, or by adding an antidiarrheal agent to the formula. However, Clostridium difficile, which is a common cause of diarrhea in patients being tube fed, should be ruled out before using antidiarrheal agents.

They may bleed massively but cause no other symptoms. Diagnosis is by upper endoscopy. Emergent endoscopy is performed after the patient's hemodynamic status has been appropriately stabilized (usually within 2-12 hours). In patients with active bleeding, endotracheal intubation is commonly performed to protect against aspiration during endoscopy.Treatment involves fluid resuscitation, endoscopic banding (sclerotherapy second choice) IV octreotide and possibly a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) procedure.[Mechanical tamponade with specially designed nasogastric tubes containing large gastric and esophageal balloons provides initial control of active variceal hemorrhage in 60-90% of patients; rebleeding occurs in 50%. Complications of prolonged balloon inflation include esophageal and oral ulcerations, perforation, aspiration, and airway obstruction (due to a misplaced balloon). Endotracheal intubation is recommended before placement. Given its high rate of complications, mechanical tamponade is used as a temporizing measure only in patients with bleeding that cannot be controlled with pharmacologic or endoscopic techniques until more definitive decompressive therapy can be provided.] ",,

The cause is usually trauma or severe stress. The information lost would normally be part of conscious awareness that could be described as autobiographic memory, eg, who one is; what one did; where one went; to whom one spoke; what was said, thought, experienced, and felt. The forgotten information sometimes continues to influence behavior.The incidence is unknown, but dissociative amnesia is most commonly diagnosed in young adults. The amnesia appears to be caused by traumatic or stressful experiences endured or witnessed (eg, physical or sexual abuse, rape, combat, abandonment during natural disasters, death of a loved one, financial troubles) or tremendous internal conflict (eg, turmoil over guilt-ridden impulses, apparently unresolvable interpersonal difficulties, criminal behaviors).The main symptom is memory loss. Characteristically, one or more episodes are experienced, in which some patients forget some, but not all, events that occurred during a period of time; others cannot recall any information. These periods, or gaps in memory, may represent only a few hours or can encompass years or even an entire lifetime. Usually the forgotten period of time is clearly demarcated.",,

The condition usually is bilateral, the nerve head is very elevated and swollen, and pupil response typically is normal.Vision is not affected initially (although there is an enlargement of the blind spot), and there is no pain upon eye movement.  Secondary optic atrophy and permanent vision loss can occur if the primary cause of the papilledema is left untreated.Optic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve.  It may affect the part of the nerve and disc within the eyeball (papillitis) or the portion behind the eyeball (retrobulbar optic neuritis, causing pain with eye movement).  It also includes degeneration or demyelinization of the optic nerve.  There will be no visible changes in the optic nerve head (disc) unless some optic atrophy has occurred.The condition is unilateral rather than bilateral.  If the nerve head is involved, it is slightly elevated, and pupillary response in that eye is sluggish.  There usually is a marked but temporary decrease in vision for several days or weeks, and there is pain in the eye when it is moved.  Single episodes generally do not result in optic atrophy nor in permanent vision loss; however, multiple episodes can result in both.",,

The cause is usually a viral infection though it is sometimes a bacterial infection; the pathogen is rarely identified. The most common symptom is cough with or without fever and/or sputum production. In patients with COPD, hemoptysis, burning chest pain, and hypoxemia may also occur. Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment is supportive; antibiotics are necessary only for patients with chronic lung disease. Prognosis is excellent in patients without lung disease, but in patients with COPD, acute respiratory failure may result. Pleurisy develops when something (usually a virus or bacterium) irritates the pleura, resulting in inflammation. Certain autoimmune diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus) can irritate the pleura. Pleurisy may also develop when cancer spreads from the lung or another part of the body to the pleura, irritating it.

The most important symptom is the development of blind spots, or areas of vision loss, over months to years. The blind spots slowly grow larger and merge. Vision loss occurs so gradually that it is often not noticed until much of it is lost. Side (peripheral) vision is usually lost first; central vision is lost last. The changes may progress to the point where only a small central island of vision remains, in which the person can see straight ahead perfectly but becomes blind in all other directions (sometimes referred to as tunnel vision). If glaucoma is left untreated, eventually even central vision can be lost, resulting in total blindness.Closed-angle glaucoma causes abrupt onset of severe pain in and around the eye, headache, redness, blurred vision, rainbow-colored halos around lights, and sudden vision loss. Nausea and vomiting may occur in response to the increased eye pressure. Closed-angle glaucoma is considered a medical emergency, because if left untreated, blindness can occur as quickly as 2 to 3 hours after the start of symptoms.",,

Desipramine has a less toxic side effect profile, especially with respect to anticholinergic effects, but its efficacy has not been well studied. This does not mean, however, that it is not an effective drug for the elderly depressed. Nortriptyline is the tricyclic that has been the most studied. The results of those studies show that it should be recommended as an antidepressant for older patients. It is effective in both the acute and continuation treatment of depression in the elderly. As far as its use in maintenance treatment, the results are mixed but at this moment there is nothing with which to compare it. It has a favorable side effect profile: low anticholinergic activity; relatively few cardiac side effects, even in patients with preexisting cardiac disease; and relatively less orthostatic hypotension.",,

It is a symptoms, not a disease in itself. At least 10% of women all over the world suffer from this complaint. Pruritus vulvae is generally relieved through scratching in the initial stages. At a later stage, the patient develops a burning sensation in this region. This can intensify to such an extent that women suffering from this complaint prefer to remain indoors and refuse to go out. This problem occurs more during the night. The patient may scratch the area during sleep and wake to find that she has made herself bleed. One of the main causes of pruritus vulvae is purulent and mucopurulent vaginal discharge. Due to this discharge, the vulva region chafes. The resulting tenderness causes pain. Over 80% of these cases occur due to this cause. In some cases prorates vulvae may develop due to the presence of skin diseases not specific to the vulva such as psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis and scabies. Other causes include animal and vegetable parasite infections which tend to cause pruritus public rather than prutitus vulvae, conditions of the urinary track like continence of urine and pyuria. Highly acidic urine sometime causes soreness which subsequently leads to pruritus. Glycosuria and diabetes, carcinoma, lichen sclerosis and crohn's disease also contribute to this condition. (Crohn disease is a chronic granulomatous inflammatory bowel disease that may primarily or secondarily involve the vulvar (2%) and inguinal regions.)Note: Vitiligo is an acquired pigmentary disorder of the skin and mucous membranes, and it is characterized by circumscribed depigmented macules and patches. It often occurs around body orifices such as the lips, genitals, gingiva, areolas, and nipples. ",,

In stool specimens stained with methylene blue, WBCs are often seen, indicating inflammatory colitis.Salmonella gastroenteritis is treated symptomatically with oral or IV fluids. For uncomplicated gastroenteritis caused by nontyphoidal Salmonella species, antimicrobial therapy is not indicated because it does not shorten the duration of illness and may prolong the duration of fecal excretion.Antimicrobial agents and hospital admission may be recommended in Salmonella gastroenteritis in infants younger than 3 months, infants younger than 12 months with temperatures of more than 39C and unknown blood culture results, and patients with hemoglobinopathies, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or other causes of immunosuppression, neoplasms, or chronic GI illnesses.

883,5,Psychiatry,Behavior therapy has been shown to be the best treatment for which one of the following? ,Obsessive-compulsive disorders,Somatization disorders,Substance abuse,Acute schizophrenia,Phobic disorders,,5,"Because many phobic disorders involve avoidance, exposure therapy, which is a form of psychotherapy, is the treatment of choice. With structure and support from a clinician who prescribes exposure homework, patients seek out, confront, and remain in contact with what they fear and avoid until their anxiety is gradually relieved through a process called habituation. Exposure therapy helps  90% of those who carry it out faithfully and is almost always the only treatment needed for specific phobias. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is effective for agoraphobia and social phobia. Cognitive-behavioral therapy involves teaching patients to recognize and control their distorted thinking and false beliefs as well as instructing them on exposure therapy. For example, patients who describe acceleration of their heart rate or shortness of breath in certain situations or places learn by being repeatedly exposed to those situations that their worries about having a heart attack are unfounded and are taught to respond instead with slow, controlled breathing or other methods that promote relaxation.",,
884,1,Medicine,"A 23 year old known drug addict is being treated with cloxacillin for confirmed acute staphylococcal endocarditis involving the aortic valve. His fever has persisted. The nursing staff calls you because he has become quite distressed and is complaining of shortness of breath. On examination, the first heart sound is barely audible and the previous full-length diastolic murmur is now of very short duration, less than 1/2 diastole. There are bibasilar rales. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate management?  ",Emergency aortic valve replacement,Continued observation with present therapy,Introduction of diuretic and afterload-reduction therapy,Antibiotic change to vancomycin,Repeat echocardiogram followed by surgery,,5,"Infective endocarditis is infection of the endocardium, usually with bacteria (commonly, streptococci and staphylococci) or fungi. It produces fever, heart murmurs, petechiae, anemia, embolic phenomena, and endocardial vegetations. Vegetations may result in valvular incompetence or obstruction, myocardial abscess, or mycotic aneurysm. Diagnosis requires demonstration of microorganisms in blood and usually echocardiography. Treatment consists of prolonged antimicrobial treatment and sometimes surgery. Surgery (debridement, valve repair or replacement) is frequently required for abscess, persistent infection despite antimicrobial therapy (ie, persistent positive blood cultures or recurrent emboli), or severe valvular regurgitation.Timing of surgery requires experienced clinical judgment. If heart failure caused by a correctable lesion is worsening (particularly when the organism is S. aureus, a gram-negative bacillus, or a fungus), surgery may be required after only 24 to 72 h of antimicrobial therapy. In patients with prosthetic valves, surgery may be required when TEE shows valve dehiscence on a paravalvular abscess, when valve dysfunction precipitates heart failure, when recurrent emboli are detected, or when the infection is caused by an antimicrobial-resistant organism.",,

About 1 out of 1,000 women with early pregnancy symptoms has a molar pregnancy.There are two types of molar pregnancy: complete and partial. Complete molar pregnancy - in place of a normal placenta and embryo, the hydatidiform mole is abnormal placental tissue that grows into a grapelike cluster that can fill the uterus. Partial molar pregnancy - the placenta grows abnormally into molar tissue. Any fetal tissue that develops is likely to have severe defects. If there are symptoms that suggest a molar pregnancy, one should do a pelvic exam, an hCG level, and a pelvic ultrasound, which can confirm a molar pregnancy. Molar pregnancy may also be found during a routine ultrasound in early pregnancy.Ultrasonography is the criterion standard for identifying both complete and partial molar pregnancies. The classic image, using older ultrasonographic technology, is of a snowstorm pattern representing the hydropic chorionic villi. High-resolution ultrasonography shows a complex intrauterine mass containing many small cysts.",,

888,1,Medicine,A 62 year old male is brought to the Emergency Department by family members after he experienced a seizure. They report his recent complaints of headache and weakness of his left hand. The most likely diagnosis is  ,Migraine,Temporal arteritis,Brain neoplasm,Cluster headache,Idiopathic epilepsy,,3,"In a brain neoplasm the cumulative effects of tumor invasion, peritumor edema, and hydrocephalus may elevate the intracranial pressure (ICP) and impair cerebral perfusion. The symptoms of brain tumors are numerous and not specific to brain tumors, meaning they can be caused by many other illnesses as well. The symptoms are caused by the tumor pressing on or encroaching on other parts of the brain and keeping them from functioning normally. Some symptoms are caused by swelling in the brain caused by the tumor or surrounding inflammation. The following symptoms are most common: headache, weakness, clumsiness, difficulty walking and seizures.Other nonspecific symptoms and signs include the following: altered mental status: changes in concentration, memory, attention, or alertness, nausea, vomiting: especially early in the morning, abnormalities in vision, difficulty with speech, gradual changes in intellectual or emotional capacity.",,

",Re-culture sputum,Pleural tap for cell morphology and acid-fast bacilli,Blood culture,Computed tomography scan of chest,Sedimentation rate,,2,"In patients with pleural effusion, the diagnosis of TB was made by detection of acid-fast bacilli by stain or by culture of mycobacteria in pleural fluid or pleural tissue (obtained by closed biopsy) or by the presence of caseating granulomas in histological sections.",,
891,2,OBGYN,"A 27 year old nulligravida presents in the office complaining of bilateral painful breasts. Clinical examination reveals that both breasts are tender and contain multiple tender, shotty nodules. The most likely diagnosis is:  ",Carcinoma of the breast,Galactocele,Fibrocystic disease of the breast,Intraductal papilloma,Fibroadenoma,,3,"Fibrocystic changes refer to mastalgia, breast cysts, and nondescript lumpiness, which may occur in isolation or together; breasts have a nodular and dense texture and are frequently tender when palpated. Fibrocystic changes cause the most commonly reported breast symptoms and have many causes. Most causes are not associated with increased risk of cancer; they include adenosis, ductal ectasia, simple fibroadenoma, fibrosis, mastitis, mild hyperplasia, cysts, and apocrine or squamous metaplasia. Other causes, particularly if fibrocystic changes require biopsy, may slightly increase risk of breast cancer. Fibrocystic changes are more common among women who had early menarche, who had their 1st live birth at age  30, or who are nulliparous.",,
892,6,Surgery,A 41 year old man had a routine chest x-ray which revealed a solid nodule (coin lesion) measuring 3.0 x 3.2 cm in the right upper lobe. Tomograms showed no evidence of a cavity or calcification. Bronchoscopy was entirely normal. Four sputa were negative for tumor cells. Tuberculin test was positive. Skin and serologic tests for coccidioidomycosis and histoplasmosis were negative. This patient should  ,Receive isoniazid 300 mg daily for 6 months,Come back in 1 month for a follow-up chest x-ray,Come back in 6 months for a follow-up chest x-ray,Enter hospital for biopsy and possible resection of the lesion,Have a second bronchoscopy in order to obtain more sputa for tumor cell search and tuberculosis studies,,4,"A solitary pulmonary nodule is defined as a discrete lesion  3 cm in diameter that is completely surrounded by lung parenchyma, does not touch the hilum or mediastinum, and is without associated atelectasis or pleural effusion.Calcification suggests benign disease, particularly if it is central (tuberculoma, histoplasmoma), concentric (healed histoplasmosis), or in popcorn configuration (hamartoma). CT scanning is often necessary to detect these patterns. Margin patterns are also suggestive. Spiculated or irregular (scalloped) margins are more indicative of malignancy. Diameter  1.5 cm strongly suggests a benign etiology; diameter  5.3 cm strongly suggests malignancy.When historical information or radiographic appearance is not diagnostic, biopsy and culture may be useful, but usually only when history supports TB or coccidioidomycosis as possible diagnoses. Although cancers can be diagnosed by biopsy, definitive treatment is resection, and so invasive testing should be reserved for patients in whom nonmalignant causes are a possibility.",,

It is most common in the first 6 weeks of life, but can occur in children up to 12 months of age. Involvement of the scalp is frequently termed cradle cap, and manifests as greasy, yellow plaques on the scalp. Other commonly affected areas include the forehead and eyebrows, nasolabial folds, and external ears. Involvement of skin creases, such as the nappy area, can lead to secondary Candidal infection and maceration.Treatment includes the use of a mild tar shampoo, oatmeal baths, and avoidance of soaps. Occasionally, a mild topical steroid may be indicated.",,

",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,Cystic fibrosis,Gastroenteritis,Pyloric stenosis,Obstructive uropathy,,4,"Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis may cause almost complete gastric outlet obstruction. It is more common in males by a 4:1 ratio. The exact etiology is uncertain, but a genetic component is likely because siblings and offspring of affected people are at increased risk. Symptoms develop between 2 and 6 weeks of life. Projectile vomiting (without bile) occurs shortly after eating. Until dehydration sets in, the child feeds avidly and otherwise appears well, unlike many of those with vomiting due to systemic illness. Gastric peristaltic waves may be visible, crossing the epigastrium from left to right. A discrete, 2- to 3-cm, firm, movable olive-like pyloric mass is sometimes palpable deep in the right side of the epigastrium. With progression of illness, the child fails to gain weight, and signs of dehydration appear.Diagnosis is by abdominal ultrasonography showing increased thickness of the pylorus (typically to  4 mm; normal,  2 mm). The classic electrolyte pattern of an infant with pyloric stenosis is that of hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis.",,
895,1,Medicine,"A 38 year old man, previously in good health, suddenly develops severe abdominal pain radiating to the left groin and associated with nausea, perspiration, and the need for frequent urination. He is restless, tossing in bed, but has no abnormal findings. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ",Herpes zoster,Left ureteral calculus,Sigmoid diverticulitis,Torsion of the left testicle,Retroperitoneal hemorrhage,,2,"Urinary calculi are solid particles in the urinary system. Symptoms, such as severe pain, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting, and sometimes gross hematuria, usually occur when calculi pass into the ureter, cause obstruction, or both. Pain (renal colic) is of variable intensity but is typically excruciating and intermittent, often occurs cyclically, and lasts 20 to 60 min. Nausea and vomiting are common. Pain in the flank or kidney area that radiates across the abdomen suggests upper ureteral or renal pelvic obstruction. Pain that radiates along the course of the ureter into the genital region suggests lower ureteral obstruction. On examination, patients may be in obvious extreme discomfort, often ashen and diaphoretic. Patients with renal colic may be unable to lie still and may pace, writhe, or constantly shift position. The abdomen may be somewhat tender on the affected side as palpation increases pressure in the already-distended ureter, but peritoneal signs (guarding, rebound, rigidity) are lacking. For some patients, the first symptom is hematuria or either gravel or a calculus in the urine. Other patients may have symptoms of a UTI, such as fever, dysuria, or cloudy or foul-smelling urine.",,

Which one of the following viscera is most likely damaged? ",Left lung,Pericardium,Left diaphragm,Left kidney,Spleen,,5,"Significant impact (eg, motor vehicle collision) can rupture a normal spleen. Rupture of the splenic capsule produces marked hemorrhage into the peritoneal cavity. The manifestations, including hemorrhagic shock, abdominal pain, and distention, are usually clinically obvious. However, splenic trauma can also produce a subcapsular hematoma, which may not rupture until hours or even months after the injury.Rupture is generally preceded by left upper quadrant abdominal pain. Splenic rupture should be suspected in patients with blunt abdominal trauma and hemorrhagic shock or left upper quadrant pain (which sometimes radiates to the shoulder); patients with unexplained left upper quadrant pain, particularly if there is evidence of hypovolemia or shock, should be asked about recent trauma. The diagnosis is confirmed by CT scan (in the stable patient), ultrasound, or peritoneal lavage (in the unstable patient).Treatment has traditionally been splenectomy. However, splenectomy should be avoided if possible, particularly in children, to avoid the resulting permanent susceptibility to bacterial infections.",,

Many common symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism are similar to those of adrenergic excess, such as nervousness, palpitations, hyperactivity, increased sweating, heat hypersensitivity, fatigue, increased appetite, weight loss, insomnia, weakness, and frequent bowel movements (occasionally diarrhea). Hypomenorrhea may be present. Signs may include warm, moist skin; tremor; tachycardia; widened pulse pressure; atrial fibrillation; and palpitations.Diagnosis is based on history, physical examination, and thyroid function tests. Serum TSH is the best test, because TSH is suppressed in hyperthyroid patients except when the etiology is a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma or pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone.

Renal function is typically normal. Minimal change disease (MCD) is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome (NS) in children 4 to 8 years, but it also occurs in adults. The cause is almost always unknown, although rare cases may occur secondary to drug use (especially NSAIDs) and hematologic malignancies.Albumin is lost in the urine of patients with MCD more so than larger serum proteins, probably because MCD causes changes in the charge barrier rather than the size barrier in the glomerular capillary wall. Lipiduria and hyperlipidemia will also be present.Diagnosis is made empirically or by renal biopsy. Prognosis is excellent.

It is important to search for symptoms or signs of congenital heart disease. Patients with innocent heart murmurs should be free of such symptoms or signs. Murmurs which are attenuated with changing body position are usually innocent.Therefore, when history is obtained and during physical examination symptoms and signs which may point to heart disease should be identified. The presence of symptoms and/or signs of heart disease will suggest the pathological nature of the heart murmur being investigated.Abnormal findings indicating a pathological origin of a heart murmur include: shortness of breath, easy fatigue, failure to thrive, cyanosis. All diastolic murmurs are pathological murmurs.",,

Which one of the following investigations provides a great advantage in confirming the diagnosis, as well as in following disease activity in the care of patients with secreting tumors? ",MRI or CT scan of the involved area of the body,MIBG (Meta iodobenzylguanidine) scan,Levels of homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid in the urine,Serum catecholamines,Serum alpha fetoproteins,,3,"Neuroblastoma is a cancer arising in the adrenal gland or less often from the extra-adrenal sympathetic chain, including the retroperitoneum, chest, and neck. Diagnosis is based on biopsy. When sensitive assays are used, 90 to 95% of tumors produce sufficient catecholamines to increase urinary metabolites. This provides a great advantage in confirming the diagnosis of neuroblastoma, as well as in following disease activity in the care of patients with secreting tumors. The two enzymes primarily responsible for the catabolism of catecholamines are catechol-O-methyl transferase and monoamine oxidase. Dopa and dopamine are converted primarily to homovanillic acid, whereas norepinephrine and epinephrine are converted primarily to vanillylmandelic acid. Most laboratories involved in neuroblastoma diagnosis measure levels of both homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid in the urine.Because of the varied clinical presentation, neuroblastoma can be confused with other neoplasms as well as nonneoplastic conditions. Diagnosis of the 5 to 10% of tumors that do not produce catecholamines is particularly difficult, as is that of the 1 % or so in which the primary tumor is not obvious.The conventional diagnostic imaging modalities include plain radiography, bone scintigraphy, CT, and MRI. The potential specificity and sensitivity of meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy for evaluation of bone and soft-tissue involvement of neuroblastoma are attractive.",,

After growing very slowly for most of human history, the world's population more than doubled in the last half century to reach 6 billion in late 1999. By 2007 it had reached 6.7 billion. Lower mortality, longer life expectancy and a youthful population in countries where fertility remains high all contributed to the rapid population growth of recent decades. According to the 2007 Revision, the world population is expected to rise in the next 43 years by 2.5 billion, to reach a total of 9.2 billion in 2050. The increase is equivalent to the total world population in 1950. Essentially all of the growth will take place in the less developed countries, and will be concentrated among the poorest populations in urban areas. By contrast, the overall population of the more developed countries is likely to show little change over the next 43 years, remaining at about 1.2 billion. Fertility is below replacement level in all 45 developed countries or areas, as well as in 28 developing countries including China. The population of developed regions is ageing and would actually decline were it not for migration. The populations of Germany, Italy, Japan and most of the successor states of the former Soviet Union are expected to be lower in 2050 than they are today.",,
914,6,Surgery,"A baseball player was struck on the left side of the head with the ball. The player fell to the ground, but did not lose consciousness. After a few hours he was seen to be confused and irritable. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ",Epidural hematoma,Subdural hematoma,Subarachnoid hemorrhage,Intracerebral hemorrhage,Post-concussion syndrome,,1,"Epidural hematoma (EDH) is a traumatic accumulation of blood between the inner table of the skull and the stripped-off dural membrane. The inciting event often is a focused blow to the head, such as that produced by a hammer or baseball bat. In 85-95% of patients, this type of trauma results in an overlying fracture of the skull. Blood vessels in close proximity to the fracture are the sources of the hemorrhage in the formation of an epidural hematoma. Because the underlying brain has usually been minimally injured, prognosis is excellent if treated aggressively. Outcome from surgical decompression and repair is related directly to patient's preoperative neurologic condition.Fewer than 20% of patients demonstrate the classic presentation of a lucid interval between the initial trauma and subsequent neurological deterioration. Following injury, the patient may or may not lose consciousness. If he or she becomes unconscious, the patient may awaken or remain unconscious.Other symptoms include the following:-Severe headache-Vomiting-SeizurePatients with posterior fossa epidural hematoma (EDH) may have a dramatic delayed deterioration. The patient can be conscious and talking and a minute later apneic, comatose, and minutes from death. ",,

",Medial collateral ligament,Oblique popliteal ligament,Anterior cruciate ligament,Lateral meniscus,Ligamentum patellae,qe86.gif,3,"Sprains of the external (medial and lateral collateral) or internal (anterior and posterior cruciate) ligaments or injuries of the menisci commonly result from knee trauma. Symptoms include pain, effusion, instability (with severe sprains), and locking (with some meniscal injuries). Diagnosis is by physical examination and sometimes MRI or arthroscopy. Anterior drawer test is the most sensitive physical test for acute anterior cruciate ligament tears. With the patient supine (with the hips flexed to 45 degrees, the knees flexed to 90 degrees and the feet flat on table) the examiner supports the patient's thigh and calf. The lower leg is moved anteriorly. Excessive passive anterior motion of the lower leg from the femur suggests a significant tear.",,

919,1,Medicine,"A 70 year old man with a history of coronary heart disease and hypertension, presents with a 3 week history of increasing shortness of breath. A chest x-ray shows a moderate sized right pleural effusion. Thoracentesis shows the protein in the pleura/serum ratio to be &lt;0.5, consistent with a transudate. These results are compatible with a pleural effusion caused by which one of the following? ",Nephrotic syndrome,Congestive heart failure,Adenocarcinoma of the lung,Hepatic vein thrombosis,Pneumonia,,2,"Transudative effusions are caused by some combination of increased hydrostatic pressure and decreased oncotic pressure in the pulmonary or systemic circulation. Heart failure is the most common cause, followed by cirrhosis with ascites and hypoalbuminemia, usually from the nephrotic syndrome. Given this patient's medical history, the cause of his pleural effusion is most likely congestive heart failure. Pleural effusions are accumulations of fluid within the pleural space. They have multiple causes and usually are classified as transudates or exudates. Detection is by physical examination and chest x-ray; thoracentesis and pleural fluid analysis are often required to determine cause. Asymptomatic transudates require no treatment. Symptomatic transudates and almost all exudates require thoracentesis, chest tube drainage, pleurodesis, and/or pleurectomy. Exudative effusions are caused by local processes leading to increased capillary permeability resulting in exudation of fluid, protein, cells, and other serum constituents. Causes are numerous, the most common being pneumonia, malignancy, pulmonary embolism, viral infection, and TB.",,

",Schizophrenia,Antisocial personality disorder,Major depressive disorder,Hypomania,Hyperthyroidism,,4,"Mania is characterized by excessive physical activity and feelings of extreme elation that are grossly out of proportion to any positive event. Hypomania is a less severe form of mania. Manic symptoms typically develop rapidly over a few days. In the early (milder) stages of mania, the person feels better than normal, exuberant, and energetic.A person who is manic may be irritable, cantankerous, or hostile. He typically believes he is quite well. A lack of insight into his condition, along with a huge capacity for activity, can make the person impatient, intrusive, meddlesome, and aggressively irritable when crossed. Mental activity speeds up (a condition called flight of ideas). The person is easily distracted and constantly shifts from one theme or endeavor to another. The person may believe he is being assisted or persecuted by others or have hallucinations, hearing and seeing things that are not there. The need for sleep decreases. A manic person is inexhaustibly, excessively, and impulsively involved in various activities (such as risky business endeavors, gambling, or perilous sexual behavior) without recognizing the inherent social dangers. In less severe mania, hospitalization may be needed during periods of overactivity to protect the person and his family from ruinous financial or sexual behavior.",,

Exact cause is unknown, but heredity, changes in the level of brain neurotransmitters, and psychosocial factors may be involved. Diagnosis is based on history. Treatment consists of drugs (eg lithium, neuroleptics), sometimes with psychotherapy. The first-line drugs for treating a manic episode during the acute phase are lithium and valproate. The newer anticonvulsants (lamotrigine, gabapentin, and topiramate) are often best reserved as back-up medications to add to firstline medications for mania, or to use instead of the first-line group if there have been difficult side effects.ECT is not indicated in the initial management of bipolar disorder.",,
923,5,Psychiatry,"A 27 year old woman seeks evaluation for her depression in an out-patient clinic. She reports episodic feelings of sadness since adolescence. Occasionally she feels good, but these periods seldom last more than 2 weeks. She is able to work but thinks she is not doing as well as she should. In describing her problems she seems to focus more on repeated disappointments in her life and her low opinion of herself than on discrete depressive symptoms.

One breast commonly develops earlier than the other. Ultimately, the breasts are symmetric, despite the discrepancy in the initial development.Breast asymmetry may develop as thelarche ensues. In this condition, one breast may develop before or more rapidly than the other. The physical examination findings usually include homogenous enlargement of one breast with no discrete masses or discharge. Accompanying breast tenderness may be present if the breast bud is starting to develop. If a mass is excluded either by physical examination or ultrasonography, the patient and parents can be reassured that the asymmetry will become less noticeable with age.",,

Which one of the following is the most likely cause of this boy's symptoms? ",Hemophilia A,Christmas disease,Factor XIII deficiency,Von Willebrand's disease,Familial platelet function disorder,,4,"Von Willebrand's disease is a hereditary deficiency of von Willebrand's factor (VWF), which causes platelet dysfunction. Bleeding tendency is usually mild. Screening tests show a prolonged bleeding time, normal platelet count, and, possibly, a slightly prolonged PTT. Diagnosis is based on low levels of VWF antigen and abnormal ristocetin cofactor activity. Treatment involves control of bleeding with replacement therapy (cryoprecipitate or pasteurized intermediate-purity factor VIII concentrate) or desmopressin. Hemophilia A and hemophilia B (Christmas disease) are X-linked congenital bleeding disorders affecting male infants, usually diagnosed through family history and prolonged PTT. Undiagnosed hemophilia may cause severe bleeding with circumcision. It can also result in significant ecchymosis with minimal trauma or joint and muscle bleeding, usually by the end of infancy or in early childhood. These children have a significantly prolonged PTT and normal PT. Diagnosis is made through measurement of Factor VIII activity for Hemophilia A and Factor IX activity for Hemophilia B.",,

",Cutaneous candidiasis,Tinea capitis,Alopecia areata,Scalp psoriasis,Seborrheic dermatitis,qe98.jpg,2,"Tinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection of the scalp (scalp ringworm). Tinea capitis mainly affects children, is contagious, and can be epidemic. Tinea capitis causes the gradual appearance of round patches of dry scale and/or alopecia. T. tonsurans infection causes black dot ringworm, in which hair shafts break at the scalp surface; M. audouinii infection causes gray patch ringworm, in which hair shafts break above the surface, leaving short stubs. Tinea capitis less commonly manifests as diffuse scaling, like dandruff, or in a diffuse pustular pattern.Dermatophyte infection occasionally leads to formation of a kerion, a large, boggy, inflammatory scalp mass caused by a severe inflammatory reaction to the dermatophyte.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria can lead to the development of cystitis or pyelonephritis. All pregnant women should be screened for bacteriuria and subsequently treated with antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin, sulfisoxazole or cephalexin. Ampicillin should no longer be used in the treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria because of high rates of resistance. Pyelonephritis can be a life-threatening illness, with increased risk of perinatal and neonatal morbidity. Recurrent infections are common during pregnancy and require prophylactic treatment.

Proteinuria changes little during pregnancy and if more than 500mg/24h is lost, a disease process should be suspected. Normally, the patient's blood pressure will not rise in pregnancy.Glucosuria during pregnancy is not necessarily abnormal, may be explained by the increase in GFR with impairment of tubular reabsortion capacity for filtered glucose. Increased levels of urinary glucose also contribute to increased susceptibility of pregnant women to urinary tract infection.

",Familial periodic paralysis,Muscular dystrophy,Polymyositis,Myasthenia gravis,Multiple sclerosis,,4,"Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder in which communication between nerves and muscles is impaired, resulting in episodes of muscle weakness. Myasthenia gravis is more common among women. It usually develops in women between the ages of 20 and 40. However, the disorder may affect men or women at any age.The most common symptoms are weak, drooping eyelids; weak eye muscles, which cause double vision; and excessive fatigue of specific muscles after exercise. In 40% of people with myasthenia gravis, the eye muscles are affected first, but 85% eventually have this problem. In 15% of people, only the eye muscles are affected, but in most people, the whole body is affected. Difficulty speaking and swallowing and weakness of the arms and legs are common. Hand grip may alternate between weak and normal; this fluctuating grip is called milkmaid's grip. The neck muscles may become weak. Sensation is not affected.When a person with myasthenia gravis uses a muscle repetitively, the muscle usually becomes weak. For example, a person who once could use a hammer well becomes weak after hammering for several minutes.

The next most appropriate step in the investigation of this patient is to do which one of the following? ",Prescribe ferrous gluconate and monitor response,Pelvic ultrasound,Bone marrow,Colonoscopy,Take a detailed dietary history,,5,"Iron deficiency anemia causes include blood loss, lack of iron in the diet and inability to absorb iron. Women with heavy periods are at risk of iron deficiency anemia because they lose a lot of blood during menstruation. Your body regularly gets iron from the foods you eat. If you consume too little iron, over time your body can become iron deficient. Examples of iron-rich foods include meat, eggs, dairy products or iron-fortified foods. For proper growth and development, infants and children need iron from their diet, too. An intestinal disorder, such as Crohn's disease or celiac disease, which affects your intestine's ability to absorb nutrients from digested food, can lead to iron deficiency anemia. If part of your small intestine has been bypassed or removed surgically, that may affect your ability to absorb iron and other nutrients. Some medications can interfere with iron absorption. To diagnose, it is important to check the hematocrit, the percentage of your blood volume made up by red blood cells and hemoglobin. Normal levels of hemoglobin range between 11.1 and 15.0 grams per deciliter (g/dL). A lower than normal hemoglobin level indicates anemia. For women a low level is less than 10 g/dL, and for men a low level is less than 12 g/dL.In addition, blood tests for iron deficiency anemia typically include a measurement of ferritin, a protein that helps store iron in your body. A low level of ferritin usually indicates a low level of iron.",,

His intermediate Mantoux skin test shows a greater than 5 mm induration. Which one of the following is the most likely underlying condition associated with this illness? ",Sickle cell disease,Alcoholism,Drug abuse,Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection,Hodgkin's disease,,4,"Tuberculosis and HIV have been closely linked since the emergence of AIDS. HIV infection has contributed to a significant increase in the worldwide incidence of tuberculosis. By producing a progressive decline in cell-mediated immunity, HIV alters the pathogenesis of tuberculosis, greatly increasing the risk of developing disease in co-infected individuals and leading to more frequent extrapulmonary involvement and atypical radiographic manifestations. The clinical presentation of pulmonary tuberculosis can vary widely in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts. In general, the presentation in the HIV-infected patient is similar to that seen in HIV-uninfected patients, although the signs and symptoms (such as fevers, weight loss, and malaise) may be attributed to HIV itself and the possibility of tuberculosis overlooked. Symptoms are usually present for weeks to months, and the acute onset of fever and cough is more suggestive of a nonmycobacterial pulmonary process. If there is no response to antimicrobial therapy, however, the possibility of tuberculosis should be considered. In HIV-infected patients, clinical manifestations of pulmonary tuberculosis reflect different levels of immunosuppression. The chest radiograph is the cornerstone of diagnosis for pulmonary tuberculosis. Upper lobe infiltrates and cavities are the typical findings in reactivation tuberculosis, whereas intrathoracic lymphadenopathy and lower lobe disease are seen in primary tuberculosis.",,

Several types of therapy can help ease pain. Physical therapy (such as stretching and strengthening activities) and low-impact exercise (such as walking, swimming or biking) can help reduce the pain. However, exercising too much or not at all can hurt chronic pain patients. Occupational therapy teaches how to pace yourself and how to do ordinary tasks differently so you won't hurt yourself. Behavioral therapy can reduce pain through methods (such as meditation and yoga) that help you relax. It can also help decrease stress.Biofeedback, a method of consciously controlling a body function that is normally regulated automatically by the body, such as skin temperature. Biofeedback is a method that uses the mind to control a body function that the body normally regulates automatically, such as skin temperature, muscle tension, heart rate, or blood pressure. Lifestyle changes such as getting daily exercise, eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, and trying complementary therapies and cognitive-behavioral therapy may help you reduce the pain or prevent it from getting worse. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) teaches relaxation techniques, stress management, and other ways to help you cope with pain. Physical, psychological, and social factors all play a role in pain management.Systematic desensitization is a type of behavioral therapy used in the field of psychology to help effectively overcome phobias and other anxiety disorders.",,

Some authorities have postulated that this difference is due to the loss of the neurotrophic effect of estrogen in postmenopausal women. The cause of AD is unknown. The prevalent notion is that most cases of AD are caused by converging risk factors that include advancing age, head injury, and lipoprotein E-epsilon 4 genotype, among other risk factors that appear to trigger a pathophysiologic cascade that, over decades, leads to dementia. Additional risk factors include low education level, smoking, Down's syndrome (Trisomy 21) and aluminum (still controversial).Familial forms of AD account for less than 7% of all cases of AD, with most cases being sporadic (ie, not inherited).",,

",Ask her to breathe into a paper bag,Order immediate intravenous infusion of a glucose solution,Order a urine drug screen,Give supplemental oxygen by mask,Administer 2 mg of sublingual lorazepam (Ativan),,2,"The symptoms of hypoglycemia rarely develop until the level of sugar in the blood falls below 60 milligrams per deciliter of blood. Some people develop symptoms at slightly higher levels, especially when blood sugar levels fall quickly, and some do not develop symptoms until the sugar levels in their blood are much lower.The body first responds to a fall in the level of sugar in the blood by releasing epinephrine from the adrenal glands. Epinephrine stimulates the release of sugar from body stores but also causes symptoms similar to those of an anxiety attack: sweating, nervousness, shaking, faintness, palpitations, tingling sensations around the mouth and hunger. More severe hypoglycemia reduces the sugar supply to the brain, causing dizziness, fatigue, weakness, headaches, inability to concentrate, confusion, inappropriate behavior that can be mistaken for drunkenness, slurred speech, blurred vision, seizures, and coma. Severe and prolonged hypoglycemia may permanently damage the brain. Symptoms can begin slowly or suddenly, progressing from mild discomfort to severe confusion or panic within minutes.",,

But they can be caused by any allergen. Like other allergic reactions, an anaphylactic reaction does not usually occur after the first exposure to an allergen but may occur after a subsequent exposure. However, many people do not recall a first exposure. Any allergen that causes an anaphylactic reaction in a person is likely to cause that reaction with subsequent exposures, unless measures are taken to prevent it.Anaphylactic reactions begin within 1 to 15 minutes of exposure to the allergen. Rarely, reactions begin after 1 hour. The heart beats quickly. The person may feel uneasy and become agitated. Blood pressure may fall, causing fainting. Other symptoms include tingling (pins-and-needles) sensations, itchy and flushed skin, throbbing in the ears, coughing, sneezing, hives, and swelling (angioedema). Breathing may become difficult and wheezing may occur because the windpipe (upper airway) constricts or becomes swollen. An anaphylactic reaction may progress so rapidly that it leads to collapse, cessation of breathing, seizures, and loss of consciousness within 1 to 2 minutes. The reaction may be fatal unless emergency treatment is given immediately.If an anaphylactic reaction occurs, an epinephrine injection should be given immediately. People who have these reactions should always carry a self-injecting syringe of epinephrine and antihistamine tablets for prompt treatment. Usually, this treatment stops the reaction. Nonetheless, after a severe allergic reaction, such people should go to the hospital emergency department, where they can be closely monitored and treatment can be adjusted as needed.",,
942,4,Pediatrics,A 2 year old toddler is brought to the emergency room 8 hours after accidental ingestion of gasoline. On examination she is afebrile and has no respiratory distress. Chest x-ray is normal. Which one of the following is the most appropriate intervention? ,Oral corticosteroid treatment,Antibiotic to prevent pneumonitis,Induce vomiting to empty the stomach,Admit to ward for observation only,"Discharge home, but to return if tachypneic",,4,"There is no antidote for gasoline poisoning. Treatment consists of support of cardiovascular and respiratory functions. In cases of ingestion, do not induce emesis or use gastric lavage and do not administer activated charcoal. Gasoline is poorly absorbed from the stomach. Catharsis with magnesium or sodium sulfate is acceptable. If spontaneous vomiting occurs, watch for signs of pulmonary aspiration.All symptomatic patients should have a chest X-ray taken no sooner than two hours post- ingestion, and should be observed in the emergency department for a period of six hours. The patient may be discharged with observation at home if asymptomatic throughout and X-ray is negative. In the presence of a positive two-hour X-ray, the patient should be admitted for monitoring of blood gases, repeat chest X-rays, and respiratory support if required.",,
5410,1,Medicine,A 60 year old diabetic male presents to the ER with fever and painful swelling of his right leg that began few hours ago. He is taking metformin and glyburide for his diabetes since he was diagnosed 5 years ago and admits to medication non-compliance.Vital signs are within normal limits except for a fever of 39 C. Examination of the leg shows raised borders of a well-demarcated area of erythema that is warm and extremely painful to touch. Cracks in the skin of the toe webs are noted on the examination of his feet.Which of the following is the most likely causative organism for the patient's condition? ,Clostridium perfringens,Actinomyces israeili,Dermatophytes,Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus pyogenes (groupA),,5,"Erysipelas, most commonly caused by group A- beta-hemolytic streptococci, is the most likely diagnosis of this patient. The characteristic finding of erysipelas is a sharply demarcated, erythematous, edematous tender skin lesion with raised borders. It is frequently seen in diabetics where a tenia pedis infection is the usual portal of entry of the infection.Staphylococcus aureus is a rare cause of erysipelas. Remember that staph aureus are coagulase positive organisms that secrete coagulase enzyme which limits the spread of the infection in the dermis.Dermatophytes are the cause of the toe web infection and not the erysipelas.Actinomyces israelii is the causative agent of cervicofacial infections characterized by the sinuses discharging sulphur granules.Clostridium perfringens is the causative agent of gas gangrene.",,
943,4,Pediatrics,A 4 month old baby has developed a fever of 40.2C and become very irritable within 8 hours of receiving his second dose of routine immunization. Which one of the following options would you consider for completing the immunization of this baby? ,Next time omit pertussis vaccine from the schedule,Give DTP instead of acellular pertussis,Omit Hib and administer DTaP and IPV,"Reassure the mother and proceed with DTaP, IPV, Hib",Omit diphtheria toxoid from the combination,,4,"Short-term, mild reactions to immunizations are common. Immunizations that may cause a fever include: Diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (DTaP) or diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (DPT). Babies can have a fever of up to 40C (104F) within 2 to 3 hours of getting the DTaP or DPT shot. Children may be fussy and have other mild symptoms such as poor appetite, sleepiness, or redness and swelling at the shot site for a few days. With Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), the shot site may become red, swollen, hard, and slightly warm within the first 24 to 48 hours. Fever also may occur 1 to 2 weeks after the shot. A mild rash may develop up to 3 weeks after the shot.Fever is a common clinical complaint in adults and children and a frequently reported adverse event following immunization. It is a generally benign and common clinical sign.",,
944,2,OBGYN,A 24 year old woman appears at 8 weeks of pregnancy and reveals a history of pulmonary embolism 7 years ago during her first pregnancy. She was treated with intravenous heparin followed by several months of oral warfarin and has had no further evidence of thromboembolic disease for over 6 years. Which of the following statements about her current condition is true? ,Having no evidence of disease for over 5 years means that her risk of thromboembolism is not greater than normal,Impedance plethysmography (IPG) is not a useful study to evaluate her for deep venous thrombosis in pregnancy,Doppler ultrasonography is not a useful technique to evaluate her for deep venous thrombosis in pregnancy,The patient should be placed on low molecular weight heparin therapy throughout her pregnancy and the puerperium,She is at highest risk for recurrent thromboembolism during the second trimester of pregnancy,,4,"As with deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE) requires objective diagnostic testing to confidently confirm or exclude the diagnosis. This is particularly true in pregnancies because the diagnosis of DVT or PE requires (1) prolonged therapy (9 months of heparin during pregnancy), (2) prophylaxis during future pregnancies, and (3) avoidance of oral contraceptive pills. The first objective diagnostic test should be compression ultrasonography; if it is not available, IPG is adequate. If the findings from noninvasive leg studies are negative, then proceed to ventilation-perfusion lung scanning. Perfusion scanning alone is recommended initially, and the ventilation scan is added when perfusion defects are noted. Although only a relatively modest amount of data have been gathered, low molecular weight heparin, which does not cross the placenta, can be given once a day and does not require monitoring. Low molecular weight heparin has not been shown to increase the risk of bleeding with surgical procedures, including cesarean delivery, in a small number of patients.",,
945,3,PMCH,The mode of disease transmission that is most difficult to prevent is,Person-to-person spread,Droplet spread,Vector spread,Vehicle spread,Airborne spread,,5,"The most difficult mode of transmission to prevent is airborne spread. An organism must be transmitted, either directly or indirectly, from one place to another. Direct transmission included person-to-person spread by skin contact and droplet spread produced by coughing, sneezing, talking or singing within close proximity of a susceptible host.Indirect transmission occurs when the reservoir and the susceptible host are separated. This type of transmission involves vector spread, vehicle spread and airborne spread.Disease disseminated by the airborne route are the most difficult to prevent and thus are able to infect large numbers of individuals in a relatively short period of time. For example, a new strain of influenza virus can spread throughout the world in a relatively short period of time.",,
946,3,PMCH,A total of 300 newly diagnosed patients with laryngeal cancer are allocated to treatment with either surgical excision alone or surgical excision plus radiation treatment. This scenario best illustrates which one of the following? ,Case series report,Case-control study,Clinical trial,Cohort study,Case report,,3,"A clinical trial is one of the final stages of a long and careful cancer research process. Studies are done with cancer patients to find out whether promising approaches to cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment are safe and effective. Treatment clinical trials test new treatments (like a new cancer drug, new approaches to surgery or radiation therapy, new combinations of treatments, or new methods such as gene therapy).",,
947,3,PMCH,"In order to study the possible association between hair dye and cancer, the most feasible study design would be which one of the following? ",Randomized controlled trial,Case-control study,Cohort study,Focus groups,Case series report,,5,"A case report is a descriptive study of a single individual (case report) or small group (case series) in which the study of an association between an observed effect and a specific environmental exposure is based on detailed clinical evaluations and histories of the individual(s). They are most likely to be useful when the disease is uncommon and when it is caused exclusively or almost exclusively by a single kind of exposure (vinyl chloride and angiosarcoma or diethylstilbestrol (DES) and clear-cell carcinoma of the vagina). Case reports (or case series) may be first to provide clues in identifying a new disease or adverse health effect from an exposure.Note: Cohort: from exposure to outcome, where a group of individuals are followed up  and Case control: from outcome to exposure.",,
948,3,PMCH,"In a randomized controlled clinical trial, the purpose of randomization is to",Keep the study subjects &quot;blind&quot; to treatment received,Keep the observers &quot;blind&quot; to treatment received,Get a random sample of the population for treatment,Minimize the bias between the two groups,,,4,"Randomization is a process that assigns research participants by chance, rather than by choice, to either the investigational group or the control group of a clinical trial. Each study participant has a fair and equal chance of receiving either the new intervention being studied (by being placed in the investigational group), or of receiving the existing or &quot;control&quot; intervention (by being placed in the control group). Research participants are randomized in clinical trials so that bias does not weaken the study results. Bias consists of human choices, beliefs or any other factors besides those being studied that can affect a clinical trial's results. If physicians or participants themselves choose the group, assignments might be personally influenced and therefore unevenly slanted toward one side or the other. For instance, if a study is not randomized, physicians might unconsciously assign participants with a more hopeful prognosis to the experimental group, thus making the new therapy seem more effective than it really is. Conversely, participants with a less hopeful prognosis might pick the experimental treatment, leading it to look less effective than it really is. Randomization prevents such bias. In a randomized trial, investigators use a computer program or a table of random numbers to assign each study participant to a group.",,

950,1,Medicine,"A 45 year old obese female patient presents to the Emergency Room with a history of right upper quadrant pain lasting two hours. She states that this is her third attack of similar pain in the past two months. The pain started suddenly and is described as sharp, constant and radiates to her right shoulder. On examination she is afebrile and has mild right upper quadrant tenderness. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ",Duodenal ulcer,Myocardial infarction,Appendicitis ,Diverticulitis,Biliary colic,,5,"Biliary colic is a condition characterized by extreme cramping pain in the right upper abdomen. Gallstones in the gallbladder, or in the bile ducts are the cause of the severe pain.About one third of patients with gallstones develop biliary colic or other complications. People who are overweight or have a high level of blood cholesterol increase their risk of developing gallstones and biliary colic. Pregnant women, or those on birth control pills or estrogen replacement therapy also have a greater risk of developing biliary colic. Other risk factors include rapid weight loss, diabetes, certain gastrointestinal conditions and certain medications.Biliary colic is caused by gallstones that form in the gallbladder or bile ducts. Gallstones form when bile, a substance made in the liver to help digest fats, contains too much cholesterol. A solid particle forms and becomes a gallstone. Biliary colic can cause extreme pain in the upper right abdomen and nausea, especially after eating a meal high in fat. The condition can also cause jaundice in the skin and eyes. The pain can last up to three hours and sometimes spreads to the right shoulder or through the center of the back. Fatty food intolerance, dyspepsia, indigestion, heartburn, flatulence and eructation are other symptoms associated with gallstone disease. Attacks of biliary colic are more common at night, possibly because the gallbladder shifts to a horizontal position, making it easier for stones to enter into the cystic duct.",,
951,6,Surgery,A 38 year old woman is to be operated on for carpal tunnel syndrome. Which one of the following structures is situated in the tunnel along with the median nerve? ,Flexor carpi radialis,Palmaris longus,Ulnar nerve,Flexor policis longus,Pronator teres,qe122.gif,4,"The carpal tunnel contains the median nerve, FPL and 4 tendons each of the FDP and FDS. Of note, with respect to the FDS tendons, the 3rd and 4th FDS tendons are volar to the 2nd and 5th FDS tendons. Flexor carpi radialis is (FCR) is not a tendon within the carpal tunnel.",,
952,1,Medicine,"The peripheral blood smear of a severely anemic patient reveals oval macrocytes, hypersegmented neutrophils, and decreased platelets. The most likely cause of the anemia is: ",A red cell membrane protein defect,Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency,An amino acid substitution in the globin chain,Marrow hypoplasia,Iron deficiency,,2,Hypersegmented neutrophils and macro-ovalocytes strongly suggest megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia is an anemia (of macrocytic classification) which results from inhibition of DNA synthesis in red blood cell production. It is often due to deficiency of vitamin B12 and/or folic acid.,,
953,6,Surgery,A 19 year old woman is admitted unconscious to the Emergency Department following a car accident. She has facial lacerations and a displaced tibial fracture. Which one of the following is the first priority in management? ,Insert an intravenous line,Insert a Foley catheter,Perform a thorough neurologic examination,Examine her airway,Check her blood pressure,,4,"ABC is a mnemonic for memorizing essential steps in dealing with an unconscious or unresponsive patient. It stands for Airway, Breathing and Circulation.If the patient's airway is blocked, oxygen cannot reach the lungs and so cannot be transported round the body in the blood. Ensuring a clear airway is the first step in treating any patient. Common problems with the airway involve blockage by the tongue or vomit.Initial opening of the airway is often achieved by a &quot;head tilt, chin lift&quot; or jaw thrust technique, although further maneuvers such as intubation may be necessary. The patient is next assessed for breathing. Common findings during an assessment of breathing may include normal breathing, noisy breathing, gasping or coughing. The rescuer proceeds to act on these based on his/her training. Generally at this point it will become clear whether or not the casualty needs supportive care (such as the recovery position) or rescue breathing.Once oxygen can be delivered to the lungs by a clear airway and efficient breathing, there needs to be a circulation to deliver it to the rest of the body. This can be assessed in a number of ways, including a pulse check, ECG analysis, or capillary refill time.",,
954,1,Medicine,You are asked to assess a 65 year old woman with a lung tumor. Routine blood test reveal that the patient is hyponatremic. You suspect the cause of hyponatremia is antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion by the tumor. Which one of the following lung tumors does this patient have? ,Squamous cell carcinoma,Adenocarcinoma,Large cell carcinoma,Small cell carcinoma,Bronchioalveolar carcinoma,,4,"Small cell lung cancer can present with a paraneoplastic syndrome called SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone). It is caused by ectopic production of ADH. Abnormalities in water and electrolyte balance, including hyponatremia, may result from production of ADH and parathyroid hormonelike hormones from small cell and nonsmall cell lung cancer.(Note: Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHRP)from squamous cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer) ",,
955,3,PMCH,A 28 year old male has received several blood transfusions following a motor vehicle accident. He is noted to have abnormal liver function tests.

It is also transmitted sexually, and in this respect, it is similar to HBV. However, approximately 40-50% (vs 1- 10% for HBV) of blood-borne infections, and 20% of community-acquired (eg., sexually) infections, will lead to chronic hepatitis, and 20% of those with chronic infection will develop cirrhosis within 10 years. Risk of transfusion-related hepatitis B is 1 per 50,000 units transfused. Risk for hepatitis C is 1 per 3000-4000 units transfused. ",,

Which one of the following is the most likely cause of the pain? ",Osteomalacia,Ankylosis spondylitis,Osteoporosis,Avascular necrosis,Osteoarthritis,,2,"The extra-intestinal manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease are numerous. Crohn's disease is associated with a type of rheumatologic disease known as seronegative spondyloarthropathy. This group of diseases is characterized by inflammation of one or more joints (arthritis) or muscle insertions (enthesitis). The arthritis can affect larger joints such as the knee or shoulder or may exclusively involve the small joints of the hand and feet. The arthritis may also involve the spine, leading to ankylosis spondylitis if the entire spine is involved or simply sacroiliitis if only the lower spine is involved.",,
957,5,Psychiatry,A 72 year old woman enters the hospital having lost 7 kg and saying she has no interest in eating. Her physical examination and laboratory findings are normal. She has been awakening at 5 a.m. for several months and cannot fall back to sleep. She says she has been feeling anxious and helpless since her husband died 3 years ago. Which one of the following is a reasonable medication to prescribe for her? ,Olanzapine,Sertraline,Clonazepam,Quetiapine,Risperidone,,2,"Many people with depression cannot experience emotions, including grief, joy, and pleasure, in a normal way; in the extreme, the world appears to have become colorless and lifeless. Thinking, speech, and general activity may slow down so much that all voluntary activities stop. Depressed people may be preoccupied with intense feelings of guilt and self-denigration and may not be able to concentrate. They may experience feelings of despair, loneliness, and low self-esteem. They can be withdrawn, speak little, stop eating, and sleep little. They are often indecisive and withdrawn, feel progressively helpless and hopeless, and think about death and suicide.Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (eg Fluoxetine (Prozac), Sertraline (Zoloft), Paroxetine (Paxil), Escitalopram (Lexapro), Citalopram (Celexa))) are now the most commonly used class of antidepressants. SSRIs are effective in treating depression and dysthymia as well as other mental health disorders that often coexist with depression. Although SSRIs can cause nausea, diarrhea, tremor, weight loss, and headache, these side effects are usually mild or go away with continued use. Most people tolerate the side effects of SSRIs better than the side effects of tricyclics. SSRIs are safer than the tricyclics in their side effects on the heart.",,

Drugs with a definite propensity to cause manic symptoms include levodopa, corticosteroids and anabolic-androgenic steroids. Antidepressants of the tricyclic and monoamine oxidase inhibitor classes can induce mania in patients with pre-existing bipolar affective disorder. Drugs which are probably capable of inducing mania, but for which the evidence is less scientifically secure, include other dopaminergic anti-Parkinsonian drugs, thyroxine, iproniazid and isoniazid, sympathomimetic drugs, chloroquine, cimetidine, baclofen, alprazolam, captopril, amphetamine and phencyclidine.",,

She takes several medications daily, although her son doesn't know what they are. The patient seems to be disheveled, mildly agitated, and delirious. Which one of the following is the most useful next step in this woman's evaluation? ",Mental status evaluation,Ordering serum electrolytes,Obtaining a CT scan of the head,Prescribing haloperidol for agitation, No further evaluation is needed,,1,"In most cases, the symptoms of dementia occur gradually, over a period of years. Symptoms of dementia caused by injury or stroke occur more abruptly. Difficulties often begin with memory, progressing from simple forgetfulness to the inability to remember directions, recent events, and familiar faces and names. Other symptoms include difficulty with spoken communication, personality changes, problems with abstract thinking, poor personal hygiene, trouble sleeping, and poor judgment and decision making. Dementia is extremely frustrating for the patient, especially in the early stages when he or she is aware of the deficiencies it causes. Dementia is diagnosed through a study of the patient's medical history and a complete physical and neurological exam. You will speak with those close to the patient to document a pattern of behavior. You will also evaluate the patient's mental functioning with tests of mental status, such as those that require the patient to recall words, lists of objects, names of objects, and recent events. Diagnostic tests, such as blood tests, x-rays, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), or computed tomography (CT) scans, can help determine the cause of the dementia.",,

961,4,Pediatrics,"A 5 year old girl is seen by her pediatrician after she has complained of headache, dizziness, tinnitus, sweating, and hyperventilation for 3 days. She was recently diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Which one of the following drugs is most likely to be associated with these adverse effects? ",Naproxen sodium,Acetaminophen,Tolmetin,Aspirin,Prednisone,,4,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease, producing damage mediated by cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteases. Peripheral joints (eg, wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints) are symmetrically inflamed, often resulting in progressive destruction of articular structures, usually accompanied by systemic symptoms. Diagnosis requires specific clinical, laboratory, and radiologic criteria. If a patient takes aspirin daily (for RA, for example), it can cause or worsen tinnitus. For this reason, aspirin is no longer used for RA, as effective doses are often toxic.",,
962,4,Pediatrics,"A term newborn infant is noted to have abdominal distention and failure to pass meconium at 48 hours of age. Sweat chloride test is negative. Abdominal x-rays show dilated loops with air-fluid levels and a granular &quot;ground glass&quot; material. A gastrografin enema is administered with good effect, as the infant passes meconium. Which one of the following investigations is indicated in the follow-up management of this infant? ",Glucose tolerance test,Barium enema,Fluid deprivation test,Gastrointestinal motility test,Rectal biopsy,,5,"In Hirschsprung's disease (congenital megacolon), a section of the large intestine is missing the nerve network that controls the intestine's rhythmic contractions. Symptoms of intestinal obstruction occur. The large intestine depends on a network of nerves within its walls to synchronize rhythmic contractions and move digested material toward the anus, where the material is expelled as feces. In Hirschsprung's disease, the affected section of intestine cannot contract normally.At the time of birth, newborns should pass a dark green fecal material (meconium). Delayed passage of meconium raises the suspicion of Hirschsprung's disease. Later in infancy, children with Hirschsprung's disease can have symptoms that suggest intestinal obstruction, bile-stained vomit, a swollen abdomen, and refusal to eat. If only a small section of the intestine is affected, a child may have milder symptoms and may not be diagnosed until later in childhood. These children may have ribbon like stools and a swollen abdomen; they often fail to gain weight. In rare cases, constipation is the only symptom.Rectal biopsy and measurement of the pressure inside the rectum (manometry) are the only tests that can reliably be used to diagnose Hirschsprung's disease. A barium enema may also be performed. During a barium enema, the doctor instills barium and air into the child's rectum and then takes x-rays.",,

",Septic abortion,Recurrent abortions,Consumptive coagulopathy with hypofibrinogenemia,Future infertility,Ectopic pregnancies,,3,"Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) begins with excessive clotting. The excessive clotting is usually stimulated by a substance that enters the blood as part of a disease (such as an infection or certain cancers) or as a complication of childbirth, retention of a dead fetus, or surgery. As the clotting factors and platelets are depleted, excessive bleeding occurs.DIC may appear to develop suddenly and usually causes bleeding, which may be very severe. If the condition follows surgery or childbirth, bleeding may be uncontrollable. Bleeding may occur at the site of an intravenous injection or in the brain, digestive tract, skin, muscles, or cavities of the body. If DIC develops more slowly, as in people with cancer, then clots in veins are more common than bleeding.Blood tests may show that the number of platelets in a blood sample has dropped and that the blood is taking a long time to clot. The diagnosis of DIC is confirmed if test results show diminished amounts of clotting factors and large quantities of proteins that are produced when clots are broken up by the body (fibrin degradation products).",,

Goal is to remove risk factors. Examples: In people with no signs of heart disease, educating them on exercise and diet, and urging them not to smoke. Giving immunizations to kids so that they don't get the diseases.Secondary Prevention is dealing with the early signs of a potential problem. Designed for early detection and treatment.Examples: Intervening with people who have high blood pressure (an early condition that might lead to heart disease), through medication or other methods. Screening higher risk patients with tests (eg cholesterol levels for obese patients, colonoscopy for those with positive family history of colon cancer).Tertiary Prevention: is treating people who have the full, actual illness.Examples: Performing heart surgery on people with advanced disease.

Theophylline toxicity is most likely to occur when serum concentrations exceed 20 mcg/mL and becomes progressively more severe at higher serum concentrations. Tachycardia, in the absence of hypoxia, fever, or administration of sympathomimetic drugs, may be an indication of theophylline toxicity. Anorexia, nausea and occasional vomiting, diarrhea, insomnia, irritability, restlessness, and headache commonly occur.

Aside from hypovolemic shock, the most immediate life-threatening complication to anticipate is  ",Gram-negative sepsis,Secondary inhalation airway injury,Acute renal failure,Hemorrhage secondary to a stress ulcer,Acute gastric dilation,,2,"Many people who have been burned in fires have also inhaled smoke. Sometimes people inhale smoke without sustaining skin burns. Smoke inhalation often causes no serious, lasting effects. However, if the smoke is unusually hot or dense or if inhalation is prolonged, serious problems can develop. The hot smoke can burn the windpipe (trachea), resulting in swelling. As the swelling narrows the trachea, airflow into the lungs is obstructed. Inhalation of chemicals released in the smoke, such as hydrogen chloride, phosgene, sulfur dioxide, and ammonia, can swell and damage the lungs and trachea. Eventually, the small airways leading to the lungs narrow, further obstructing airflow. Smoke can also contain chemicals that poison the body's cells, such as carbon monoxide and cyanide.",,

During the illness, frequent small feedings of clear fluids may be given. Increasing difficulty in breathing, bluish skin discoloration, fatigue, and dehydration indicate that the child should be hospitalized. Children with congenital heart or lung disease or an impaired immune system may be hospitalized sooner and are far more likely to become quite ill from bronchiolitis. With proper care, the chance of dying of bronchiolitis is low, even for children who need to be hospitalized.In the hospital, oxygen levels are monitored with a sensor on a finger, toe, or an earlobe, and oxygen is given by an oxygen tent or face mask. A ventilator may be needed to assist breathing. Intravenous fluids are given if the child cannot drink adequately. Inhaled drugs that open the airways (bronchodilators) may be tried, although their effectiveness in bronchiolitis is questionable. The antiviral drug ribavirin may be given by nebulizer to infants who are premature or who have other conditions that put them at high risk for severe breathing problems, such as congenital heart or lung disease, cystic fibrosis, or AIDS. Antibiotics are not helpful.",,
971,2,OBGYN,A 32 year old woman presents to the outpatient clinic with a 7 month history of amenorrhea and hot flushes. She denies any symptoms of pregnancy and the uterus is of normal size. The most appropriate test to support a diagnosis of premature ovarian failure is:  ,Diagnostic laparoscopy,Serum testosterone,Karyotype,Serum luteinizing hormone and follicule-stimulating hormone,Medroxyprogesterone withdrawal test,,4,"Premature menopause (premature ovarian failure - POF) is the permanent end of menstrual periods before age 40 because the ovaries become unable to produce hormones because ovulation stops. You should suspect premature menopause when women younger than 40 have menopausal symptoms. Studies to establish the diagnosis of POF are as follows:-Measuring serum FSH level is the core study to establish the diagnosis of POF after pregnancy has been ruled out. By convention, 2 FSH levels in the menopausal range for the specific assay (40 IU/mL by radioimmunoassay), measured at least 1 month apart, are diagnostic of POF.-Measurement of serum LH is also important. In most cases of spontaneous POF, FSH is higher than LH. If autoimmune oophoritis is present, FSH may be only mildly elevated, sometimes below the cutoff of 40 IU/mL, while LH is markedly elevated.-A parallel test of serum estradiol is necessary. As a rule, serum estradiol is low in women with POF and is similar to or less than the early follicular phase estradiol of women who cycle normally. The combination of low estradiol and high gonadotropins defines POF. ",,
972,2,OBGYN,A 23 year old asymptomatic woman is seen for routine examination. You are able to palpate a 4 cm diameter right-sided cystic adnexal mass. The appropriate management is:  ,Laparoscopy,Trans-vaginal aspiration,Pelvic ultrasound examination,Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist,Reassessment in 1 month,,3,"Adnexal masses are frequently found in both symptomatic and asymptomatic women. In premenopausal women, physiologic follicular cysts and corpus luteum cysts are the most common adnexal masses, but the possibility of ectopic pregnancy must always be considered. Other masses in this age group include endometriomas, polycystic ovaries, tubo-ovarian abscesses and benign neoplasms. Malignant neoplasms are uncommon in younger women but become more frequent with increasing age. In postmenopausal women with adnexal masses, both primary and secondary neoplasms must be considered, along with leiomyomas, ovarian fibromas and other lesions such as diverticular abscesses. Information from the history, physical examination, ultrasound evaluation and selected laboratory tests will enable you to find the most likely cause of an adnexal mass.",,
973,1,Medicine,"A 55 year old male smoker undergoes a physical examination and laboratory workup for a life insurance application. History and physical examination, including rectal examination, are normal. Blood count is also normal, but urinalysis reveals the presence of blood in the urine (&gt; 20 RBC/HPF). Cystoscopy is negative. Abdominal ultrasound reveals a 5 cm solid mass in the upper pole of the left kidney, confirmed by computerized tomography scan. Which one of the following is the most appropriate management?  ",Computerized tomography scan guided percutaneous biopsy,Retrograde pyelogram,Repeat computerized tomography scan in 6 months,Intravenous pyelogram,Surgical resection,,5,"In addition to taking a complete medical history and performing a physical exam, blood and urine tests a CT and biopsy is likely needed in the diagnosis. Computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. CT scans use computers to create more detailed images than those produced by conventional X-rays. MRI scans use magnetic fields and radio waves to generate cross-sectional pictures of your body. Biopsies are commonly performed on tumors that develop in a ureter or in the kidney pelvis, the area at the center of the kidneys where urine collects. During a biopsy, a sample of tissue is removed and examined under a microscope. It's the only way to confirm the presence of cancer. A solid kidney tumor, on the other hand, is often removed without a biopsy because these tumors are almost always cancerous and because a needle biopsy may spread cancer cells outside the biopsied kidney.",,
974,2,OBGYN,A 40 year old woman mother of four children and whose last child had problems at birth with hemolytic disease of the newborn has just been rushed to the emergency room following a motor vehicle accident. She has lost a lot of blood and needs immediate transfusion but there is no time to cross and type her blood. She should receive blood that is:  ,"O, Rh positive","AB, Rh positive","O, Rh negative","AB, Rh negative","B, Rh positive",,3,"Blood is classified by type. A person's blood type is determined by the presence or absence of certain proteins (Rh factor and blood group antigens A and B) on the surface of red blood cells. The four main blood types are A, B, AB, and O, and for each type, the blood is either Rh-positive or Rh-negative. For example, a person with O-negative blood has red blood cells that lack both A and B antigens and the Rh factor. A person with AB-positive blood has red blood cells that have A and B antigens and the Rh factor. Some blood types are far more common than others. A blood transfusion is safest when the blood type of the transfused blood precisely matches the recipient's blood type. Therefore, before a transfusion, blood banks perform a test called a &ldquo;type and cross-match&rdquo; on the donor's and the recipient's blood. This test minimizes the chance of a dangerous or possibly fatal reaction. However, in an emergency, anyone can receive type O red blood cells. Thus, people with type O blood are known as universal donors. People with type AB blood can receive red blood cells from any blood type and are thus known as universal recipients. Recipients whose blood is Rh-negative must receive blood from Rh-negative donors, but recipients whose blood is Rh-positive may receive Rh-positive or Rh-negative blood.Hemolytic disease of the newborn occurs in women who are Rh-negative.",,
975,6,Surgery,"A 75 year old man with chronic bronchitis develops a bulge in his left groin. On examination, an elongated swelling is seen above the medial end of the inguinal ligament. When the patient coughs, the swelling enlarges, but does not descend into the scrotum. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  ",Femoral hernia,Acquired hydrocele,Inguinal lymphadenopathy,Inguinal hernia,Incomplete descent of left testis,inghernia.jpg||inghernia.jpg,4,"An inguinal hernia usually produces a painless bulge in the groin or scrotum. If the hernia can slide back and forth, the bulge may enlarge when a patient stands or strains. The bulge may get smaller or disappear when the patient lies down. If the hernia is incarcerated, the bulge does not get smaller or disappear. Strangulated hernias usually become very painful within minutes or hours.To diagnose an inguinal hernia, you should examine the groin and the area around it. For the examination, a patient may have to stand and cough or strain. Coughing or straining produces pressure in the abdomen and makes a hernia more obvious. To determine whether the hernia is reducible or incarcerated, you should try to push the loop of intestine back into the abdomen by pushing on the upper part of the scrotum with a gloved finger. ",,

","TSH increased, free T4 increased","TSH decreased, free T4 increased","TSH increased, free T4 decreased","TSH decreased, free T4 decreased","TSH within normal range, free T4 within normal range",,3,"Hypothyroidism is common, especially among older people, particularly women; it affects about 10% of older women. It can, however, occur at any age. Insufficient thyroid hormone causes body functions to slow. Symptoms are subtle and develop gradually. They may be mistaken for depression, especially among older people. Facial expressions become dull, the voice is hoarse and speech is slow, eyelids droop, and the eyes and face become puffy. Many people with hypothyroidism gain weight, become constipated, and are unable to tolerate cold. The hair becomes sparse, coarse, and dry, and the skin becomes coarse, dry, scaly, and thick.Usually hypothyroidism can be diagnosed with one simple blood test: the measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone, which will be high due to a lack of negative feedback. A second blood test is needed to measure the level of the thyroid hormone T4 that is not bound by protein (free). A low level confirms the diagnosis of hypothyroidism.",,

",Addison's disease,Cushing's syndrome,Bartter's syndrome,Renal artery stenosis,Conn's syndrome,,2,"In Cushing's syndrome, the level of corticosteroids is excessive, usually from overproduction by the adrenal glands. Corticosteroids alter the amount and distribution of body fat. Excessive fat develops throughout the torso and may be particularly noticeable at the top of the back. A person with Cushing's syndrome usually has a large, round face (moon face). The arms and legs are usually slender in proportion to the thickened trunk. Muscles lose their bulk, leading to weakness. High corticosteroid levels over time raise the blood pressure, weaken bones (osteoporosis), and diminish resistance to infections. The risk of developing kidney stones and diabetes is increased, and mental disturbances, including depression and hallucinations, may occur. Women usually have an irregular menstrual cycle. Children with Cushing's syndrome grow slowly and remain short. In some people, the adrenal glands also produce large amounts of androgens (testosterone and similar hormones), leading to increased facial and body hair in women and balding.When doctors suspect Cushing's syndrome, they measure the level of cortisol, the main corticosteroid hormone, in the blood. Normally, cortisol levels are high in the morning and lower late in the day. In people who have Cushing's syndrome, cortisol levels are very high throughout the day.",,

In the last year alone, he has been to Bangkok, New Delhi, Jeddah, and Dar es Salaam He returned from Africa only three weeks ago. Which of the following diagnosis is most likely?  ",Dengue fever,Meningococcal meningitis,Tuberculosis,Malaria,HIV,,4,"Malaria is infection of red blood cells with one of four species of Plasmodium, a protozoan. Malaria causes fever, chills, sweating, an enlarged spleen, and anemia (due to the breakdown of infected red blood cells). Although drugs and insecticides have made malaria rare in the North America and in most industrialized countries, the disease remains common and deadly in other areas. Malaria may occur in North American travelers returning from tropical areas.After infection occurs, symptoms usually appear within a few weeks to several months, but they may not occur until years later. The initial symptoms of all forms of malaria are similar. As the infected red blood cells rupture and release parasites, a person typically develops a shaking chill followed by a fever that can exceed 104 F (40 C). Fatigue and vague discomfort (malaise), headache, body aches, and nausea are common. The fever typically falls after several hours, and heavy sweating and extreme fatigue follow. Fevers occur unpredictably at first, but with time, they may become periodic.",,
983,1,Medicine,"A 55 year old woman presents with ptosis and diplopia. On examination of the eye, the pupil is widely dilated and non-reactive to light. Which one of the following is likely injured?  ",Oculomotor nerve,Trochlear nerve,Trigeminal nerve,Abducent nerve,Optic nerve,,1,"The oculomotor nerve is the third of twelve paired cranial nerves. It controls most of the eye's movements, constriction of the pupil, and maintains an open eyelid. Since the oculomotor nerve controls most of the eye muscles, it may be easier to detect damage to it. Damage to this nerve, termed oculomotor nerve palsy is also known by the down n' out symptoms, because of the position of the affected eye.The oculomotor nerve also controls the constriction of the pupils. This can be tested in two main ways. By moving a finger towards a person's face to induce accommodation, as well as them going cross-eyed, their pupils should constrict. Shining a light into their eyes should also make their pupils constrict. Both pupils should constrict at the same time, independent of what eye the light is actually shone on.",,
984,5,Psychiatry,"In the emergency room you are asked to assess a 67 year old man with alcoholic cirrhosis and recent alcohol cessation. He is agitated, confused and hallucinating.

",Diazepam,Nitrazepam,Chlordiazepoxide,Lorazepam,Clonazepam,,4,"Delirium tremens (DT), a very serious set of symptoms, may result if alcohol withdrawal is left untreated. Delirium tremens usually does not begin immediately; rather, it appears about 2 to 10 days after the drinking stops. In delirium tremens, the person is initially anxious and later develops increasing confusion, sleeplessness, nightmares, excessive sweating, and profound depression. The pulse rate tends to speed up. Fever typically develops. DT is treated with benzodiazepines. Among the benzodiazepines, diazepam offers the most rapid time to peak clinical effects, which limits oversedation.

She has not previously been diagnosed with peptic ulcer disease. What would be the preferred treatment option?  ,Combination antibiotics plus omeprazole,Omeprazole alone,Surgical vagotomy and pyloroplasty,Octreotide,Ranitidine,,1,"A peptic ulcer is a round or oval sore where the lining of the stomach or duodenum has been eaten away by stomach acid and digestive juices. Because infection with H. pylori bacteria is a major cause of ulcers, antibiotics are often used. Neutralizing or reducing stomach acid by taking drugs that directly inhibit the stomach's production of acid promotes healing of peptic ulcers regardless of the cause. In most people, treatment is continued for 4 to 8 weeks. Proton pump inhibitors (eg omeprazole) are the most potent of the drugs that reduce acid production. Proton pump inhibitors promote healing of ulcers in a greater percentage of people in a shorter period of time than do histamine (H2) blockers.",,
986,5,Psychiatry,"A 32 year old female with a history of depression presents with restlessness, nausea and unstable vital signs. She was recently switched from citalopram (SSRI) to phenelzine (MAOI). On examination her blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg and she is tachycardic and tachypneic. Her neurological examination is normal aside from hyperreflexia and myoclonous. What is the most likely diagnosis?  ",Neuroleptic malignant syndrome,Serotonin syndrome,Akathisia,Hypertensive crisis,SSRI withdrawal,,2,"The most common severe adverse effect associated with SSRIs is the development of serotonin syndrome. This syndrome was first described in patients treated with MAOIs who were given other drugs that enhance serotonergic activity. However, ingestion of an MAOI is not required for this syndrome to develop, and its development is unpredictable.Drug interactions resulting in serotonin syndrome can occur while switching serotonergic pharmacologic agents when an insufficient time lag occurs before initiating the alternative therapy. Residual pharmacologic effect, receptor downregulation or upregulation, and the presence of active metabolites may be causative in these circumstances.Symptoms of serotonin syndrome include altered mental status, agitation, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, tremor, diarrhea, incoordination, muscle rigidity, and hyperthermia. The clinical manifestations of serotonin syndrome are diverse, and minor manifestations are common after initiation of SSRI and atypical antidepressant therapy.Differential Diagnosis of the Serotonin Syndrome from the Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome: In addition to the associated medications, the time courses of the two syndromes are substantially different. Signs and symptoms of the serotonin syndrome develop within minutes to hours after exposure to the offending agents, whereas NMS typically develops days to weeks after daily exposure to the drug in question. In addition, after symptoms develop and offending drugs are discontinued, NMS can last for as long as 2 weeks, whereas the serotonin syndrome usually resolves quickly, coinciding with the offending drug's pharmacokinetic metabolism. A review of the literature indicates that patients presenting with serotonin syndrome were more likely to exhibit agitation, hyperactivity, clonus and myoclonus, ocular oscillations, shivering, tremors, and hyperreflexia, whereas patients presenting with NMS were more likely to exhibit bradykinesia and lead pipe rigidity.

The QRS complexes begin to widen when the patient's serum potassium level reaches about 6-6.5 mEq/L, becoming markedly slurred and abnormally widened at 10 mEq/L. The QRS complexes may widen so that they merge with the T waves, resulting in a &quot;sine wave&quot; appearance. The ST segments disappear when the serum potassium level reaches 6 mEq/L and the T waves typically become tall and peaked at this same range.

",Salmonellae enterocolitis,Clostridium perfringens,Entamoeba hystolytica colitis,Giardia Lamblia infection,Cryptosporidium parvum infection,,1,"Infection with the gram-negative bacilli Salmonella results in gastroenteritis and sometimes local tissue infections. It can produce gastrointestinal upset, enteric fever, and specific localized infections. With the exception of the type that causes typhoid fever, Salmonella infects the digestive tracts of many domestic and wild animals, birds, and reptiles. Contaminated foods, particularly meat, poultry, eggs, egg products, and raw milk, are common sources of Salmonella. Another source is infected pet reptiles (snakes, lizards, turtles). Up to 90% of pet reptiles in the North America are infected with Salmonella. Symptoms of Salmonella infection are usually confined to the digestive tract and start 12 to 48 hours after ingesting Salmonella. The first symptoms are nausea and cramping abdominal pain, soon followed by watery diarrhea, fever, and sometimes vomiting. The infection is often gone within 1 to 4 days, but it may last much longer. Some people become carriers and continue to pass the bacteria in their stool well after symptoms are gone.Rarely, Salmonella leaves the intestines and travels through the bloodstream to infect other sites, such as the bones (particularly in people with sickle cell disease), joints, or heart valves. Occasionally, a tumor may become infected and develop an abscess that provides a source for continued blood infection. Diagnosis is confirmed in a laboratory by culturing a rectal swab or sample of stool or blood taken from an infected person.Note:Some bacteria (eg, Staphylococcus aureus,Bacillus cereus,Clostridium perfringens) produce an exotoxin that is ingested in contaminated food. The exotoxin can cause gastroenteritis without bacterial infection. These toxins generally cause acute nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea within 12 h of ingestion of contaminated food. Symptoms abate within 36 h.Other bacteria (eg, Shigella,Salmonella,Campylobacter, some E. coli strains) invade the mucosa of the small bowel or colon and produce microscopic ulceration, bleeding, exudation of protein-rich fluid, and secretion of electrolytes and water. The invasive process and its results can occur whether or not the organism produces an enterotoxin. The resulting diarrhea contains WBCs and RBCs and sometimes gross blood. ",,

Which one of the following nerves is most likely injured?  ,Radial nerve,Musculocutaneous nerve,Ulnar nerve,Long thoracic nerve,Axillary nerve,,5,"The axillary nerve innervates the teres minor and then divides into anterior and posterior branches to innervate the posterior, middle, and anterior deltoid muscle. In addition, it provides sensation to the glenohumeral joint and the skin overlying the deltoid muscle.Injury to the axillary nerve can occur close to the inferior capsule of the glenohumeral joint, where it is susceptible to direct trauma secondary to glenohumeral dislocation, laceration during surgery, as well as to direct compression such as during the misuse of crutches. Entrapment of this nerve can also occur at the quadrilateral space. Injuries to the axillary nerve at the quadrilateral space can occur as a result of stretching or crushing. The axillary nerve palsy causing dysfunction of the deltoid muscle is a catastrophic event to the shoulder girdle. Forward elevation can be limited to 33 degrees (range of 0 to 75 degrees). With this degree of loss of motion, attempts at elevation and abduction will result in superior subluxation of the humeral head. The patient, however, may use trick movements to achieve full elevation of the arm by rotating the scapula, contracting the rotator cuff, long head of the biceps, and clavicular portion of the pectoralis major muscle.",,

Abdominal aortic aneurysms tend to run in families and to occur in people who have high blood pressure, especially those who also smoke. About 20% of abdominal aneurysms eventually rupture.Rupture is accompanied by the abrupt onset of back and abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, the presence of a palpable pulsatile mass, hypotension, and shock. Of note, a ruptured aneurysm may mimic other conditions, including abdominal colic, renal colic, diverticulitis, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Not surprisingly, more than 25% of patients presenting with rupture or expansion of an aortic aneurysm are initially misdiagnosed.Patients with impending or actual rupture must be managed as a surgical emergency in a manner similar to that used for patients with major trauma. Such patients rapidly develop hemorrhagic shock, manifested by peripheral vasoconstriction, hypotension, mottled skin, diaphoresis, oliguria, disorientation, and cardiac arrest.

998,1,Medicine,A 48 year old alcoholic man has had a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and the INR is well-controlled on warfarin. He is noted to have an INR of 6.0 following a weekend binge. Which one of the following is the most likely pharmacological explanation of this finding?  ,Alcohol intake decreases the volume of distribution of warfarin,Alcohol intake increases the absorption of warfarin from the gut,Alcohol competes for and reduces the hepatic metabolism of warfarin,Alcohol reduces the plasma protein binding of warfarin,Alcohol reduces the renal excretion of warfarin,,3,"Intermediate use (2-3 drinks per day) probably does not alter the INR at all.Intermittent large amount of alcohol drinking leads to an increase in INR, because the alcohol interferes with warfarin metabolism, i.e. warfarin is metabolized less rapidly.Chronic heavy alcohol intake results in a decreased INR, because the alcohol actually increases the metabolism of warfarin.

999,1,Medicine,"A 68 year old man presents to the emergency room with a four day history of worsening headaches and confusion. He is on no medications. Physical examination confirms the confusion, but is otherwise normal. His plasma sodium is found to be 117 mmol/L (normal 135 - 145 mmol/L) and plasma osmolality is 248 mmol/kg H20 (normal 285 - 295mmol/kg H20). Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  ",Hypoadrenalism,Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion,Congestive heart failure,Pseudohyponatremia,Hyperthyroidism,,2,"A cause of hyponatremia is the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). People who have SIADH have a low sodium level because the pituitary gland secretes too much antidiuretic hormone. Hyponatremia also occurs in people who have underactive adrenal glands and who thus excrete too much sodium in the urine. This can result in a low plasma osmolality due to the excess water being brought back into the bloodstream by the excess ADH.When the sodium level in the blood falls quickly, symptoms tend to develop rapidly and be more severe. The brain is particularly sensitive to changes in the sodium level in the blood. Therefore, symptoms such as lethargy and confusion occur first. As hyponatremia becomes more severe, muscle twitching and seizures may occur; stupor, coma, and death may follow. The diagnosis of hyponatremia is made by measuring the sodium level in the blood.",,

",Serum ferritin and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC),Schilling's test,Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase assay,Hemoglobin electrophoresis,Serum folate and cobalamin (vitamin B12),,1,"Hypochromic anemia is a form of anemia characterized by a disproportionate reduction of red cell hemoglobin in proportion to the volume of the erythrocyte and an increased area of central pallor in the red cells. Hypochromic anemia is most commonly caused by iron deficiency from a low iron intake, diminished iron absorption, or excessive iron loss. It can also be caused by infections or other diseases, therapeutic drugs, and lead poisoning. Diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is made by obtaining levels of serum iron, ferritin and TIBC.",,

The tests that make up a lipid profile are tests that have been shown to be good indicators of whether someone is likely to have a heart attack or stroke caused by blockage of blood vessels (hardening of the arteries). The full lipid profile includes total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol (often called good cholesterol), LDL-cholesterol (often called bad cholesterol), and triglycerides. Sometimes the report will include additional calculated values such as the Cholesterol/HDL ratio or a risk score based on lipid profile results, age, sex, and other risk factors.",,

",Digoxin,Furosemide,Thiazides,Spironolactone,Mannitol,,2,"There are several types of medications used to treat congestive heart failure in children. A diuretic like furosemide (Lasix), which helps the kidneys to eliminate extra fluid in the lungs, is often the first medicine given both in babies and older children. Sometimes medicines to lower the blood pressure like an ACE inhibitor (Captopril) or more recently beta-blockers (Propranolol) are used. Theoretically, lowering the blood pressure will decrease the workload of the heart by decreasing the amount of pressure against which it has to pump. Sometimes a medication called Digoxin is used to help make the heart squeeze better, and help pump blood more efficiently. Since weight gain is a major challenge for infants with congestive heart failure, giving babies high calorie formula or fortified breast milk can help give the extra nutrition they require.",,

Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  ",Narcissistic personality disorder,Oppositional defiant disorder,Schizophrenia,Borderline personality disorder,Bipolar disorder,,4,"People with a borderline personality, most of whom are women, are unstable in their self-image, moods, behavior, and interpersonal relationships. Their thought processes are more disturbed than those of people with an antisocial personality, and their aggression is more often turned against the self. They are angrier, more impulsive, and more confused about their identity than are people with a histrionic personality. Borderline personality becomes evident in early adulthood but becomes less common in older age groups.People with a borderline personality often report being neglected or abused as children. Consequently, they feel empty, angry, and deserving of nurturing. They have far more dramatic and intense interpersonal relationships. When they fear being abandoned by a caring person, they tend to express inappropriate and intense anger. People with a borderline personality tend to see events and relationships as black or white, good or evil, but never neutral.When people with a borderline personality feel abandoned and alone, they may wonder whether they actually exist (that is, they do not feel real). They can become desperately impulsive, engaging in reckless promiscuity, substance abuse, or self-mutilation. At times they are so out of touch with reality that they have brief episodes of psychotic thinking, paranoia, and hallucinations.",,

Almost all people have been exposed to CMV by the time they are adults, but the virus usually does not make otherwise healthy people sick. However, some people are at increased risk for active infection and serious complications: Babies born to women who have a first-time CMV infection during pregnancy. Pregnant women who work with infants and children. Persons with weakened immune systems, including cancer patients on chemotherapy, organ transplant recipients, and persons with HIV infection Active infection in otherwise healthy children and adults can cause prolonged high fever, chills, severe tiredness, a generally ill feeling, headache, and an enlarged spleen.Most infected newborns have no symptoms at birth, but, in some cases, symptoms will appear over the next several years. These include mental and developmental problems and vision or hearing problems. In rare cases, a newborn can have a life-threatening infection at birth. Infants and children who get CMV infection after birth have few, if any, symptoms or complications. When symptoms do appear, they include lung problems, poor weight gain, swollen glands, rash, liver problems, and blood problems.People with weakened immune systems can have more serious, potentially life-threatening illnesses, with fever, pneumonia, liver infection, and anemia. Illnesses can last for weeks or months and can be fatal. In persons with HIV infection, CMV can infect the retina of the eye (CMV retinitis) and cause blindness.",,

The cold, dry air of winter also makes nosebleeds more likely. People who take aspirin or other drugs that interfere with the blood's ability to clot (anticoagulants) commonly develop nosebleeds. Some people get them rather often, and others rarely get them.Bleeding usually comes from the front part of the nasal septum, which contains many blood vessels. There may be just a trickle of blood or a strong stream. Most nosebleeds are more frightening than serious.",,

The most common symptom is a swollen, red area that feels warm and tender. An uncommon type of breast cancer called inflammatory breast cancer can produce similar symptoms. A breast infection is treated with antibiotics.Staphylococcal breast infections (mastitis) and abscesses typically develop 1 to 4 weeks after delivery. The infected area is red and painful. Breast abscesses often release large numbers of bacteria into the mother's milk, and these milk-borne bacteria may infect the nursing infant.",,

Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  ,Ulcerative colitis,Salmonella gastroenteritis,Giardiasis,Colonic polyp,Campylobacter gastroenteritis,,1,"Ulcerative colitis is a chronic disease in which the large intestine becomes inflamed and ulcerated (pitted or eroded), leading to flare-ups (bouts or attacks) of bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever. The long-term risk of colon cancer is increased. Ulcerative colitis may start at any age but usually begins between the ages of 15 and 30. A small group of people have their first attack between the ages of 50 and 70.The symptoms of ulcerative colitis occur in flare-ups. A flare-up may be sudden and severe, producing violent diarrhea (typically bloody), high fever, abdominal pain, and peritonitis (inflammation of the lining of the abdominal cavity). During such flare-ups, the person is profoundly ill. More often, a flare-up begins gradually, and the person has an urgency to have a bowel movement (defecate), mild cramps in the lower abdomen, and visible blood and mucus in the stool. A flare-up can last days or weeks and can recur at any time.If the disease extends farther up the large intestine, the stool is looser, and the person may have as many as 10 to 20 bowel movements a day. Often, the person has severe abdominal cramps and distressing, painful spasms that accompany the urge to defecate. There is no relief at night. The stool may be watery and contain pus, blood, and mucus. Frequently, the stool consists almost entirely of blood and pus. The person also may have a fever and a poor appetite and may lose weight.",,

The cause of Kawasaki Disease is unknown, but if the symptoms are recognized early, kids with the disease can fully recover within a few days. If it goes untreated, it can lead to serious complications that can involve the heart.The symptoms of Kawasaki Disease typically appear in phases. The first phase, which can last for up to 2 weeks, usually involves a persistent fever that is higher than 104 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius), and lasts for at least 5 days. The other symptoms that typically develop include: severe redness in the eyes, a rash on the child's stomach, chest, and genitals, red, dry, cracked lips, swollen tongue with a white coating and big red bumps, sore, irritated throat, swollen palms of the hands and soles of the feet with a purple-red color and swollen lymph nodes.During the second phase of the illness, which usually begins within two weeks of when the fever first begins, the skin on the child's hands and feet may begin to peel in large pieces.

",Needle thoracentesis,Give him morphine,Check him for head injury,Give him a sedative,Catheterize his bladder,,1,"This patient has just had a motor vehicle accident with obvious chest trauma. Any such patient that presents with symptoms of extreme dyspnea, restlessness, anxiety, agitation and decreased breath sounds should be evaluated immediately for a tension pneumothorax with a chest x-ray.A tension pneumothorax occurs secondary to blunt or penetrating injury of the lung which results in a one-way valve being created. Air leaks from the lung out into the pleural space and is unable to escape, resulting in increased intrapleural pressure.The most immediate goal in the treatment of tension pneumothorax is to alleviate the increased intrapleural pressure. Once the pleural space has been evacuated, if pneumothorax recurs or is persistent, a tube thoracostomy should be performed.",,

",She should undergo cesarean section to protect her infant from infection,Her fetus has an increased risk of congenital malformations,Transplacental transmission to her fetus is a significant concern,Breast-feeding of her infant is probably unsafe,Decisions regarding route of delivery are best made at onset of labour,,5,"With genital herpes, if a woman does have a lesion or prodromal symptoms at delivery, the safest practice is a cesarean delivery to prevent the baby from coming into contact with active virus. Many women find that their outbreaks tend to increase as the pregnancy progresses, probably because of the immune suppression that takes place to prevent the mother's body from rejecting the fetus. Between 10% and 14% of women with genital herpes have an active lesion at delivery. The odds are higher for women who acquire herpes during pregnancy, and lower for women who have had herpes for more than six years.If a woman doesn't have herpes lesions at the time of delivery, the standard of care recommended is vaginal delivery. This does expose the baby to a very small risk of infection from possible asymptomatic shedding.",,

Most types of antidepressants, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (eg Paroxetine), and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), are effective . Benzodiazepines work faster than antidepressants but can cause drug dependence and are probably more likely to cause sleepiness, impaired coordination, and slowed reaction time. SSRIs are the preferred drugs because they are as effective as the other drugs but usually have fewer side effects.",,

",Echovirus,Adenovirus,Parvovirus B19,Measles,Coxsackie virus,,3,"Erythema infectiosum (fifth disease, parvovirus B19 infection) is a contagious viral infection that causes a blotchy or raised red rash with mild illness. Erythema infectiosum is caused by human parvovirus B19 and occurs most often during the spring months, often in geographically limited outbreaks among children and adolescents. Infection is spread mainly by breathing in small droplets that have been breathed out by an infected person. The infection can also be transmitted from mother to fetus during pregnancy, rarely resulting in stillbirth or severe anemia and excess fluid and swelling (edema) in the fetus (hydrops fetalis).Symptoms begin about 4 to 14 days after infection but many children have none. However, some have a low fever and feel mildly ill for a few days. Seven to 10 days later, children develop red cheeks that often look like they have been slapped as well as a rash, especially on the arms, legs, and trunk but not usually on the palms or soles. The rash can be itchy and consists of raised, blotchy red areas and lacy patterns, particularly on areas of the arms not covered by clothing, because the rash may be worsened by exposure to sunlight.",,

According to recent studies, in a vast majority of women who receive complete hysterectomies, an annual Pap smear is unnecessary. A complete hysterectomy must include removal of the cervix. Women whose cervix has been removed and who have had no cancerous or precancerous lesions detected in the years preceding the procedure do not have to undergo an annual Pap exam according to the study. This does not imply however that women do not need an annual OB/GYN appointment. On the contrary, all women should still submit to an annual pelvic exam, as all women are still at risk for reproductive disorders including ovarian disease.The test remains an effective, widely used method for early detection of pre-cancer and cervical cancer. The test may also detect infections and abnormalities in the endocervix and endometrium. ",,

Adults should be given a routine booster dose of Td every 10 years. Adults age 19-64 years who have never received Tdap should receive a single dose of Tdap to replace a single dose of Td so they can boost their resistance to pertussis as well.If someone experiences a deep or puncture wound, or a wound contaminated with dirt, an additional booster dose may be given if the last dose was more than five years ago. It is important to keep an up-to-date record of all immunizations so that repeat doses don't become necessary.",,

Which one of the following is the most likely etiologic agent?  ",Escherichia coli,Haemophilus influenzae,Neisseria meningitidis,Streptococcus pneumoniae,Staphylococcus aureus,,4,"Meningitis in newborns usually results from an infection of the bloodstream (sepsis). The infection is typically caused by bacteria acquired from the birth canal, most commonly group B streptococci, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. Older infants and children usually develop infection through contact with respiratory secretions from infected people. Bacteria that infect older infants and children include Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. Haemophilus influenzae type b was the most common cause of meningitis, but widespread vaccination against that organism has now made it a rare cause. This patient's causative agent is most likely Streptococcus because of the skipped vaccination.Older children and adolescents with meningitis typically have a few days of increasing fever, headache, confusion, and a stiff neck. They may have an upper respiratory tract infection that is unrelated to the meningitis. Newborns and infants rarely develop a stiff neck and are unable to communicate specific discomfort. These younger children become fussy and irritable (particularly when they are held) and stop feeding, important signs that should alert parents to a possibly serious problem. Sometimes newborns and infants have fever, vomiting, or a skin rash. One third have seizures.",,

",Cerebral vascular disease,Hydrocephalus,Huntington's disease,Alzheimer's disease,Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,,4,"In Alzheimer's disease, the ability to remember, think, understand, communicate, and control behavior progressively declines because brain tissue degenerates. The symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are similar to those of other dementias. They include memory loss, changes in personality, problems using language, disorientation, difficulty doing daily activities, and disruptive behavior. A person with Alzheimer's disease may not have all the symptoms.Symptoms usually begin subtly. People may not notice any changes at first, depending on what activities they are involved in. At some point, people with Alzheimer's disease may notice they are not doing their job or activities quite as well as in the past.In most people with Alzheimer's disease, the first sign is forgetting recent events. But the disease may begin with changes in personality. For example, people may become emotionally unresponsive, depressed, or unusually fearful or anxious. Or emotions may rapidly and unpredictably change from one extreme to another. Early in the disease, people have difficulty using language. They may use a general word or many words rather than a specific word, use words incorrectly, or be unable to find the right word. They become less able to use good judgment and think abstractly.",,

Sometimes the pain seems to occur near the joint rather than in it. Temporomandibular disorders may be the reason for recurring headaches that do not respond to usual medical treatment. Other symptoms include pain or stiffness in the neck radiating to the arms, dizziness, earaches or stuffiness in the ears, and disrupted sleep.People with temporomandibular disorders have difficulty opening their mouth wide. For example, most people without temporomandibular disorders can place the tips of their index, middle, and ring fingers held vertically in the space between the upper and lower front teeth without forcing. For people with temporomandibular disorders (with the exception of hypermobility), this space usually is markedly smaller.50% of patients with a TMJ disorder notice ear pain but do not have signs of infection. The ear pain is usually described as being in front of or below the ear. Often, patients are treated multiple times for a presumed ear infection, which can often be distinguished from TMJ by an associated hearing loss or ear drainage (which would be expected if there really was an ear infection).",,
1020,1,Medicine,A 68 year old patient presents with an acutely red and swollen right great toe without history of trauma. Which one of the following findings is most useful for making a diagnosis in this patient?  ,Joint aspiration,Good response to colchicine trial,Radiograph showing marginal joint erosion in the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint,An associated right ankle effusion,Painless elbow nodule,,1,"Gout is a disorder that results from deposits of sodium urate crystals, which accumulate in the joints because of high blood levels of uric acid (hyperuricemia), leading to attacks of painful joint inflammation.Attacks of gout (acute gouty arthritis) can occur without warning. They may be triggered by an injury, surgery, consumption of large quantities of alcohol or purine-rich food, fatigue, emotional stress, or illness. Typically, severe pain occurs suddenly in one or more joints, often at night (probably because of the metabolic changes that occur when a person lies down). The pain becomes progressively worse and is often excruciating, particularly when the joint is moved or touched. The joint becomes inflamed, it swells and feels warm, and the skin over the joint appears red or purplish, tight, and shiny.A high uric acid level in the blood supports the diagnosis; however, this level is often normal, especially during an acute attack. A blood test may show increased numbers of white blood cells due to the inflammation caused by the urate crystals. The diagnosis is confirmed when needle-shaped urate crystals are identified in a sample of a tophus or in joint fluid removed (joint aspiration) with a needle and viewed under a microscope with polarized light.",,

Which one of the following would have the most prognostic value?  ,Age,Urinary obstructive symptoms,Positive family history,Pathological grade (Gleason score),Adenosquamous histology,,4,"Prognosis for prostate cancer involves the following main factors: Stage and Gleason grade or score.Stage: As with many other types of cancer, the outcome of prostate cancer depends on whether it has spread when it is diagnosed. Gleason grade or score: With prostate cancer, the prognosis also depends on how the cells look under the microscope. This is called the grade of the cancer. In prostate cancer, this is recorded as the Gleason score. A Gleason score of 2, 3 or 4 indicates a low grade prostate cancer that is likely to grow very slowly. A Gleason score of 5, 6 or 7 is an intermediate grade that will grow at a moderate rate. A Gleason score of 8 to 10 is a high grade cancer that is likely to grow relatively fast.",,
1022,6,Surgery,A 75 year old woman with Alzheimer's disease falls in the nursing home and hits her head. No fractures are noted on a skull radiograph. She has fluctuating levels of consciousness and complains of headache on the left side of her head. Mydriasis is noted in the left pupil. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?  ,Epidural hematoma,Subdural hematoma,Subarachnoid hemorrhage,Intracerebral hemorrhage,Hemorrhagic infarction of the brain,,2,"Subdural hematomas are caused by bleeding from the bridging veins, located between the outer and middle layers of tissue covering the brain (meninges). Subdural hematomas may be acute, subacute, or chronic. Rapid bleeding after a severe head injury can cause acute subdural hematomas, with immediate symptoms, or subacute subdural hematomas, with symptoms that develop over several hours. Symptoms are delayed because chronic subdural hematomas tend to enlarge very slowly.Chronic subdural hematomas are more common among alcoholics and among older people. Alcoholics, who are relatively prone to falls and other injuries, may ignore minor to moderately severe head injuries. These injuries can lead to small subdural hematomas that may become chronic. In older people, the brain shrinks slightly, stretching the bridging veins and making them more likely to be torn if an injury, even a minor one, occurs. Also, bleeding tends to continue longer because older people heal more slowly. Early compression of the oculomotor nerve by a subdural hematoma or other mass may be indicated by a dilated pupil (mydriasis).",,

The fetal heartbeat is audible with the Doppler fetoscope but not with the DeLee stethoscope. At her second visit one month later she has just felt fetal quickening. The uterine fundus measure 17 cm. Which one of the following would describe the state of gestation?  ",10 to 12 weeks,14 to 16 weeks,16 to 20 weeks,20 to 24 weeks,24 to 28 weeks,,3,"In pregnancy terms, the moment of quickening refers to the initial motion of the fetus in the uterus as it is perceived or felt by the pregnant woman. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, to quicken means to reach the stage of pregnancy at which the child shows signs of life. A woman pregnant for the first time (i.e. a primiparous woman) typically feels fetal movements at about 20-21 weeks, whereas a woman who has already given birth at least two times (i.e. a multiparous woman) will typically feel movements around 18 weeks.Since as a rule of thumb, the fundal height (in centimeters) should roughly equal the number of weeks of pregnancy, this patient is probably at 16-20 weeks gestation.",,

For posterior mediastinal mass the median age at diagnosis was 6 years. Thirty patients were female. Forty-five percent of the patients presented with respiratory symptoms or chest pain; 13% had neurologic symptoms, one half of which were related to spinal cord compression; and 5% had a palpable mass. In 32% of patients the mass was an incidental finding. The tumors were of neurogenic origin in 89% of patients, of which neuroblastoma was the most common.

The child smiles and plays with his parents, but his language development is behind that of other children his age. His mother has noticed that he rarely responds to her commands, or reacts to noises around him. He has been growing well physically. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  ",Mental retardation,Deafness,Mixed receptive-expressive language disorder,Tourette disorder,Pervasive developmental disorder,,2,"Hearing loss can be present at birth or progress over time. Hearing loss can be hereditary or acquired by environmental means. As the majority of children with hearing loss have no other abnormalities or distinguishing features (called non-syndromic hearing loss), many children have late diagnosis of their loss with significant consequences in delay in language acquisition from the delay in diagnosis. Accurate testing in children can be difficult primarily of a child's inability to respond during standard testing. Other tests have been developed that require no direct response from children being tested. These tests are utilized in the hospital just after birth (universal screening) that is identifying children with hearing loss at an early age and allowing for early and appropriate therapy. Advances in genetic testing (molecular biology) has led to the ability to diagnose the cause of hearing loss in many felt to previously to have an unknown cause for their hearing loss.Behavioral problems may be major or minor, and they are probably best correlated with the child's personality and with how the parents deal with what they may consider a stubborn child. Before speech impediments, mental retardation, autism, attention deficit, or adjustment disorders are presumed, many children could benefit from a hearing evaluation.  ",,

A CT of the abdomen will most like show which of the following? ,Cholangiocarcinoma,Hepatic adenoma,Cholelithiasis,Choledocholithiasis,,,2,"A hepatocellular adenoma is a relatively uncommon noncancerous liver tumor that may be mistaken for cancer. Rarely, it ruptures and bleeds or becomes cancerous. Hepatocellular adenomas occur mainly in women of childbearing age, particularly those who use oral contraceptives.Usually, these tumors cause no symptoms, so most remain undetected. Large adenomas may cause pain in the upper right part of the abdomen. Rarely, a hepatocellular adenoma suddenly ruptures and bleeds into the abdominal cavity, requiring emergency surgery. Very rarely, these tumors become cancerous.An adenoma is usually suspected when an imaging test, such as ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT), is done and shows an abnormality. Sometimes a biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis.Hepatocellular adenomas caused by oral contraceptive use may disappear when the woman stops taking the drug. If adenomas are large or located near the surface of the liver, surgery is recommended because bleeding and cancer are risks.",,

(In theory, anything that hampers the migration of the embryo to the endometrial cavity could predispose women to ectopic gestation.)Some organisms causing PID, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy. A history of salpingitis increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy 4-fold. The incidence of tubal damage increases after successive episodes of PID (ie, 13% after 1 episode, 35% after 2 episodes, 75% after 3 episodes).After one ectopic pregnancy, a patient incurs a 7- to 13-fold increase in the likelihood of another ectopic pregnancy. Overall, a patient with prior ectopic pregnancy has a 50-80% chance of having a subsequent intrauterine gestation, and a 10-25% chance of a future tubal pregnancy.",,

",Transient tachypnea of newborn,Ventral septal defect,Pulmonary hypoplasia,Diaphragmatic hernia,,qe201.gif,4,"A diaphragmatic hernia is a birth defect, which is an abnormality that occurs before birth as a fetus is forming in the mother's uterus. An opening is present in the diaphragm (the muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity). With this type of birth defect, some of the organs that are normally found in the abdomen move up into the chest cavity through this abnormal opening.Respiratory distress usually develops shortly after the baby is born, because of ineffective movement of the diaphragm and crowding of the lung tissue, which causes collapse. The reason why this occurs is not known. Symptoms include severe breathing difficulty, bluish coloration of the skin due to lack of oxygen, fast breathing (tachypnea) asymmetry of the chest wall and fast heart rate (tachycardia).Examination of the infant shows: chest movements asymmetric with breathing, breath sounds absent on the affected side and bowel sounds heard in the chest.

",Vitamin B6 deficiency,Vitamin B12 deficiency,Vitamin C deficiency,Vitamin D deficiency,Folic acid deficiency,,3,"Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is essential for the formation, growth, and repair of bone, skin, and connective tissue (which binds other tissues and organs together and includes tendons, ligaments, and blood vessels). Vitamin C helps maintain healthy teeth and gums. It helps the body absorb iron, which is needed to make red blood cells. Vitamin C also helps burns and wounds heal. In adults, vitamin C deficiency usually results from a diet low in vitamin C. For example, vitamin C deficiency may result from a diet deficient in fresh fruits and vegetables. Also, cooking can destroy some of the vitamin C in food. Pregnancy, breastfeeding, disorders that cause a high fever or inflammation, surgery, and burns can significantly increase the body's requirements for vitamin C and the risk of vitamin C deficiency. Smoking increases the vitamin C requirement by 30%. Incidence also peaks in elderly populations, who sometimes have &quot;tea-and-toast&quot; diets deficient in vitamin C.",,

",Dietary intake assessment,Urine metanephrines,CT of chest,Plasma Renin Activity and 24 hour urine collection for aldosterone estimation,,,4,"In primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's disease), overproduction of aldosterone leads to fluid retention and increased blood pressure, weakness, and, rarely, periods of paralysis. Hyperaldosteronism can be caused by a tumor in the adrenal gland or may be a response to some diseases. High aldosterone levels can cause high blood pressure and low potassium levels; low potassium levels may cause weakness, tingling, muscle spasms, and periods of temporary paralysis. Doctors measure the levels of sodium, potassium, and aldosterone in the blood. Sometimes, a tumor is removed, or people take drugs that block the action of aldosterone.Doctors who suspects hyperaldosteronism first tests the levels of sodium and potassium in the blood. Doctors may also measure aldosterone levels. If they are high, spironolactone or eplerenone, drugs that block the action of aldosterone, may be given to see if the levels of sodium and potassium return to normal. In Conn's syndrome, the levels of renin are also very low.When too much aldosterone is being produced, doctors examine the adrenal glands for a noncancerous tumor (adenoma). Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be helpful, but sometimes blood samples from each of the adrenals must be tested to determine the source of the hormone.",,

There is no anisocoria, and the &quot;bad eye&quot; still senses light and produces pupillary constriction to some degree, albeit reduced. The commonest cause of Marcus Gunn pupil is a lesion of the optic nerve (before the optic chiasm) or severe retinal disease.The Marcus Gunn phenomenon is a relative afferent pupillary defect. That is to say, the &quot;bad eye&quot; can still perceive light and respond to it, but not as much as the &quot;good eye&quot;; the bad eye is relatively less responsive than the good eye, but both eyes are still responsive to light.

However, if you shine the light in the &quot;good eye&quot;, the pupils will constrict even more. It is as if you are shining a light of lesser intensity at the bad eye.In context of the swinging flashlight test, you first shine the light in the good eye, causing full pupillary contraction in both eyes. Then you move the light to the bad eye. The bad eye perceives this same light as if were not as bright, and thus causes the pupils to constrict less. This gives the illusion that both pupils are now dilating as a response to the light.

Also, bleeding tends to continue longer because older people heal more slowly. After the blood is resorbed from a hematoma, the brain may not re-expand as well in older people as in younger people. As a result, a fluid-filled space (hygroma) may be left. Symptoms may include a persistent headache, fluctuating drowsiness, confusion, memory changes, paralysis on the opposite side of the body, and other symptoms depending on which area of the brain is damaged.

It is a physiologic phenomenon that occurs during puberty, when at least half of males experience enlargement of one or both breasts. Pubertal hypertrophy is characterized by a tender discoid enlargement of the breast tissue beneath the areola and usually subsides spontaneously within a year. Gynecomastia also is common among elderly men, particularly when there is associated weight gain. This condition is usually temporary and benign. It may be caused by hormonal imbalance, medication with estrogens or steroidal compounds, or failure of the liver to inactivate circulating estrogen, as in alcoholic cirrhosis.The causes of gynecomastia are multiple. A search for a common mechanism has not been successful. A number of researchers believe that in many cases (but not all), an altered androgen/estrogen ratio causes changes in cellular elements in breast tissue.

IgA nephropathy is a kidney disorder that occurs when IgAa protein that helps us fight infectionssettles in the kidneys. After many years, the IgA deposits may cause the kidneys to leak blood and sometimes protein in the urine.Many people with IgA nephropathy leak blood in the urine, but this leakage does not mean they will have long-term problems. Others leak both blood and protein in the urine. If too much protein leaks into the urine, the hands and feet can swell. In the early stages, IgA nephropathy has no symptoms. This disease can be silent for years, even decades. The first sign of IgA nephropathy may be blood in the urine. The blood may appear during a cold, sore throat, or other infection. At times, blood in the urine can only be detected by your doctor or nurse using special tests. If the amount of blood increases, you may notice that your urine is pink or the color of tea or cola.",,

Blood pressure is 170/95, urine analysis shows specific gravity 1020, nitrites negative, + blood and + protein. Urine microscopy reveals oxalate crystals, dysmorphic red blood cells and red cell casts. The presence of dysmorphic red blood cells is indicative of: ",Urine infection,Delay in analysis of the urine sample,Glomerular bleeding,Urothelial malignancy,Urinary tract calculus,,3,"Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy is the most common form of glomerulonephritis in the world; caused by immune complexes (combinations of antigens and antibodies) deposited in the kidney. Usually the disorder progresses slowly; end-stage kidney failure develops in about 20% to 40% of people after 5 to 25 years; progresses more slowly in children. IgA nephropathy is a kidney disorder that occurs when IgA settles in the kidneys. After many years, the IgA deposits may cause the kidneys to leak blood and sometimes protein in the urine.A urine test called urinalysis usually provides the first clues. In a urinalysis, the doctor or nurse dips a special strip with chemicals into the urine sample. The strip changes color when blood or protein is present in the urine. If the test strip is positive, the urine will then be examined with a microscope to look for red blood cells. The red blood cells may be clumped together to form little tubes. These tubes are called casts because they are formed or molded inside the kidneys' tiny draining structures. If casts are found, it usually means the kidney filters are damaged.",,

Factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A) has an X-linked genetic transmission. Because these genes are located on the X chromosome, hemophilia affects males almost exclusively. Daughters of hemophilic males are obligate carriers, but sons are normal. Each son of a carrier has a 50% chance of having hemophilia, and each daughter has a 50% chance of being a carrier.Patients with hemophilia bleed into tissues (eg, hemarthroses, muscle hematomas, retroperitoneal hemorrhage), and the bleeding may be delayed after trauma. Pain often occurs as bleeding commences, sometimes before other signs of bleeding develop. Chronic or recurrent hemarthroses can lead to synovitis and arthropathy. Even a trivial blow to the head can cause intracranial bleeding. Bleeding into the base of the tongue can cause life-threatening airway compression.",,

An immature immunologic system makes them vulnerable to more virulent bacteria as well as viral infections.The routine workup for febrile neonates must be more aggressive than in other age groups because of the greater probability of a serious bacterial infection and our inability to predict which neonates have serious infections. All febrile neonates should have a blood culture drawn, a lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid culture and studies, and urine obtained by catheterization for urinalysis and culture. Chest films should be taken when respiratory symptoms are present. Stool leukocytes and culture are indicated in neonates with diarrhea. A white blood cell (WBC) count is usually obtained also.All febrile neonates should be hospitalized and receive intravenous antibiotics, even when laboratory screening tests are normal.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is: ",Acute myelogenous leukemia,Diabetic retinopathy,Childhood hypertensive retinopathy,Child abuse (shaken baby syndrome),Retinal edema,,4,"When a baby is vigorously shaken, the head moves back and forth. This sudden whiplash motion can cause bleeding inside the head and increased pressure on the brain, causing the brain to pull apart and resulting in injury to the baby. This is known as Shaken Baby Syndrome, and is one of the leading forms of fatal child abuse. A baby's head and neck are susceptible to head trauma because his or her muscles are not fully developed and the brain tissue is exceptionally fragile. Head trauma is the leading cause of disability among abused infants and children.Shaken Baby Syndrome occurs most frequently in infants younger than six months old, yet can occur up to the age of three. Often there are no obvious outward signs if inside injury, particularly in the head or behind the eyes. In reality, shaking a baby, if only for a few seconds, can injure the baby for life. These injuries can include brain swelling and damage; cerebral palsy; mental retardation; developmental delays; blindness; hearing loss; paralysis and death.

Appropriate management of this patient would be ",Left carotid endarterectomy,Right carotid endarterectomy,Coumadin anti-coagulation,Enteric coated aspirin,Watchful waiting with regular follow-up,,2,"Carotid stenosis refers to the blockage and narrowing of the carotid artery in the neck. The carotid artery supplies blood to the brain. This blockage is causes by fatty build up called plaque and is also referred to as atherosclerosis. This fatty material accumulates in the inner lining of blood vessels and results in narrowing, stenosis and irregularity of the artery. This may result in the formation of blood clots which dislodge and flow up to the brain.For a patient with 50% occluded artery medication may be prescribed to try and prevent a thromboembolic event (a blood clot to the brain). Medication such as aspirin, and plavix interfere with platelet function that is involved in blood clotting. Other medication are anticoagulants and these interfere with the formation of a blood clot. Heparin and coumadin are examples.Carotid endarterectomy may be recommended. Under a general anesthetic the surgeon exposes and opens the carotid artery. Meticulous removal of the plaque and precise closure of the vessel with a microsurgical technique.The following are indications for carotid endarterectomy based on prospective randomized trials:-Symptomatic patients with greater than 70% stenosis-Symptomatic patients with greater than 50-69% stenosis: benefit is marginal and appears to be greater for male patients.-Asymptomatic patients with greater than 60% stenosis: benefit is significantly less than symptomatic patients with greater than 70% stenosis.",,

Which of the following procedures is appropriate for this patient ",Force feed,Provide adequate analgesia,Initiate parental nutrition,Prescribe antidepressants,,,2,"Terminally ill patients often report that they fear intractable pain more than they do dying. Patients frequently express the desire to have open and honest dialogue about pain and want to be involved fully in planning their pain management. A doctor must be able to get alongside the patient and their family and to spend time presenting options, answering questions and quelling fears. Having promised to keep the patient relatively pain-free, it is paramount to meet this promise to preserve trust. Pain is easier to prevent than it is to relieve and drugs should be prescribed on a prophylactic basis with no other consideration than maintaining the patient's quality of life.Pain is a complex subjective phenomenon and is affected by the emotional context in which it is endured. Adequate psychological support is critical as removing the fear of pain in itself will help to optimize pain control. A patient who is fearful, withdrawn and depressed often appears to have a lower pain threshold than one who is still actively engaged in enjoying what is left of their lives, even though they may have same stage disease. Non-drug measures to help psychological or spiritual distress may be as important as medication in relieving pain and suffering.",,

",Ovarian cyst,Ectopic pregnancy,Spontaneous abortion,Molar pregnancy,,,4,"A hydatidiform mole is growth of an abnormal fertilized egg or an overgrowth of tissue from the placenta. Most often, a hydatidiform mole is an abnormal fertilized egg. The abnormal egg develops into a hydatidiform mole rather than a fetus (a condition called molar pregnancy). However, a hydatidiform mole can develop from cells that remain in the uterus after a miscarriage or a full-term pregnancy.Women who have a hydatidiform mole feel as if they are pregnant. But because hydatidiform moles grow much faster than a fetus, the abdomen becomes larger much faster than it does in a normal pregnancy. Severe nausea and vomiting are common, and vaginal bleeding may occur. These symptoms indicate the need for prompt evaluation by a doctor. Often, doctors can diagnose a hydatidiform mole shortly after conception. No fetal movement and no fetal heartbeat are detected. As parts of the mole decay, small amounts of tissue that resemble a bunch of grapes may pass through the vagina.

It is caused by inhalation of asbestos particles over prolonged periods of time. Asbestosis takes approximately 15 to 20 years to show its effects. The inhaled asbestos fibers initially damage the cell membranes in the lungs, causing the lung tissues to harden and form scars. This is known as fibrosis. During the initial stages of disease only the outer lung tissues get scarred, but as the disease progresses, it affects the entire lungs. The hardening of lung tissues make breathing difficult, thus reducing the oxygen intake. Pressure on the lungs increase because of its inability to remove carbon dioxide and replace it with fresh oxygen. This is the reason it is known as a restrictive lung disease. Persons suffering from asbestosis are more prone to develop bronchitis and pneumonia. Symptoms of Asbestosis may include one or more of the following: shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing, constant dry cough, constant pain in the chest, pulmonary hypertension, excess phlegm.

The physician-patient relationship is the concept at the core of this question specifically, does the personality of the patient play a role in how a physician behaves? The answer generally speaking is no, it does not. Each patient should be approached in the same professional and courteous manner. All patients should be informed about issues concerning their care and they should be made to feel comfortable.This standard approach may not be effective for all patients in that some patients may report that their physician is cold or aloof while others might report that the physician is friendly or quite personable.

1077,1,Medicine,A 68 year old white man comes to the office because of increasing shortness of breath on exertion for the past 2 to 3 months. He has a history of hypertension for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide. On physical examination his pulse is 80/min. There is an apical lift displaced to the left and a harsh diastolic murmur at the base. Further physical examination is most likely to show: ,Bifid pulse,Low-amplitude pulse,Pulsus alternans,Pulsus paradoxus,Wide pulse pressure,,5,"This patient most likely has aortic insufficiency. One of the hallmark physical findings of this valvular lesion is the presence of a wide pulse pressure secondary to the diastolic run-off back into the ventricle. Other signs such as Quincke's pulse or Musset's sign may also be present. A bifid pulse is seen with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and is best appreciated by palpation of the carotid artery. This bifid pulse occurs as a result of no obstruction to blood flowing out from the left heart chamber in the beginning, followed by an obstruction in the middle of systole, and finally by a lessening of the obstruction at the end of systole. Low amplitude pulse is seen with peripheral arteriosclerosis. Pulsus alternans where one pulse feels large, the next pulse feels small, is appreciated with severe congestive heart failure. Pulsus paradoxus is an exaggeration of a normally present fall is systolic blood pressure with inspiration. Normal decrease in systolic pressure should be 10 mm Hg or less but with pulsus paradoxus, it can be 15-20 mm Hg.

",Attempt to persuade her to share the information with at least one adult member of her family,Explain that by law you are unable to maintain confidentiality,Explore with her the reasons for her not feeling comfortable sharing the information with her parents,Point out that she will not be able to hide her pregnancy for very long,"Reassure her, but notify her mother after she leaves",,3,"Explore with the patient her reasons for not feeling comfortable with sharing this information. In this manner, you can discuss specific reasons for her reluctance to involve her parents, and counsel her appropriately. An attempt to persuade her to share the information with a parent may only exacerbate an already tenuous relationship with her parents. Explaining that by law you are unable to maintain confidentiality is incorrect. She requires counseling and telling her that you an unable to maintain confidentiality will only make it more difficult for her to trust you. A minor is typically considered to be an &ldquo;emancipated minor&rdquo; and capable of making independent medical decisions if they become pregnant or have a sexually transmitted disease, therefore breaching confidentiality is incorrect. Indicating that she will not be able to hide her pregnancy for long is a nonproductive argument, and does not preempt a discussion.

Waiting until next season is too long and, although likely to allow a large margin of safety, will unnecessarily keep the student from playing his sport. The Monospot test is the diagnostic test that detects the antibody generated against the EBV (heterophil antibody) in the blood of the patient. Since the immune response is last quite long, a negative Monospot test may take years to become present. Waiting for the patient to be symptom free is also too long as fatigue may persist for months after the resolution of the lymph node enlargement. The CBC may return to normal well before the lymph nodes have regressed in size.",,

Records show he has lost 5.4 kg (12 lb) since his last routine visit 6 months ago. Today, on physical examination, there are several large, nontender, anterior and posterior cervical lymph nodes. His medical history includes infectious mononucleosis, hepatitis B, impetigo, prostatitis and tinea versicolor. Which of the following factors in his history is most suggestive of pneumonia related to a sexually transmitted disease? ",Hepatitis B,Impetigo,Infectious mononucleosis,Prostatitis,Tinea versicolor,,1,"This man's past medical history includes multiple prior infections, including mononucleosis, hepatitis B, prostatitis, and tinea versicolor. Furthermore, he has had a subacute illness with weight loss, fevers, and a nonproductive cough. The history of hepatitis B and prostatitis in a young man with these symptoms should always suggest the possibility of HIV infection transmitted through homosexual activity. Of the listed infections, hepatitis B is the infection most likely to be transmitted sexually.",,
1093,3,PMCH,"A male colleague asks you to write a prescription for a narcotic analgesic for one of his female patients. You have noticed that this patient has been coming by the office to see your colleague too frequently, and that most of the visits have been marked &quot;No complaints/Normal physical exam&quot;  When you ask your colleague why he cannot write the prescription himself, he seems defensive and says, &quot;because I don't want anybody to get the wrong idea.&quot; Which of the following is the most appropriate response to your colleague?  ",&quot;It sounds like there is more to this story than you are telling me; maybe we should talk about it.&quot;,"&quot;I wish I could help you, but I never prescribe that medication for a patient unless I have seen the patient myself.&quot;","&quot;I will do this for you once, but I will need to see your patient in the office before I can write another prescription.&quot;","&quot;Maybe I should see your patient in the office myself, and then decide if she needs the medication.&quot;","&quot;You have seemed a little nervous lately. You aren't getting in over your head, are you?&quot;",,1,"This question clearly describes a situation in which a colleague may be behaving inappropriately with a female patient. This is suggested by the frequent &ldquo;no complaints&rdquo; visits and his defensive posture when questioned. This choice indicates awareness by the physician of a possible inappropriate physician-patient relationship, and indicates a willingness to help. It would not be appropriate to accuse the colleague directly, given the lack of evidence. On the other hand, there is clearly enough information given in this question to raise suspicion.",,
1094,1,Medicine,"A 25 year old woman returns to the office for a follow-up visit. She was last seen 2 weeks ago because of a facial rash that worsens with sun exposure. Today she says she has joint pain. She says, &quot;It just hurts everywhere. Sometimes my knees hurt, and sometimes it's my elbows or my ankles. And I have been feeling tired all the time. I just don't have any energy.&quot; She denies any joint swelling. An office urinalysis shows 3+ protein. You consider the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus and plan additional diagnostic testing. If she has systemic lupus erythematosus, studies are most likely to show which of the following?  ",Decreased numbers of helper T cells,Decreased serum concentrations of C3 and C4,Increased numbers of plasma cells,Serum antimicrosomal antibodies,Serum antiplatelet antibodies,,2,"Lupus is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect various parts of the body, especially the skin, joints, blood, and kidneys. Arthralgia and skin rashes are very common findings in these patients. The ANA antibody test is often used as a first test in the diagnostic evaluation of lupus. Laboratory tests which measure complement levels in the blood are also of some value. Complement is a blood protein that, with antibodies, destroys bacteria. It is an &ldquo;amplifier&rdquo; of immune function. If the total blood complement level is low, or the C3 or C4 complement values are low, and the person also has a positive ANA, some weight is added to the diagnosis of lupus. Low C3 and C4 complement levels in individuals with positive ANA test results may also be indicative of lupus kidney disease. Decreased helper (CD4) T cells are characteristic of certain hereditary T-cell deficiencies as well as acquired ones such as AIDS. Increased B cells are characteristic of certain leukemias, lymphomas, or disorders such as multiple myeloma. Serum antimicrosomal antibodies are characteristic of subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis. This occurs most often in the postpartum period but may also occur sporadically. Antimicrosomal antibodies are present in 50 to 80% of patients, while antithyroid peroxidase antibodies are present in nearly all patients. Serum antiplatelet antibodies are found in disorders such as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and certain idiopathic thrombocytopenias.",,

1096,6,Surgery,"A 62 year old woman comes to the office because of pain in the left lower quadrant of her abdomen for the past 48 hours. The pain is associated with tenesmus, loss of appetite and a sensation of being febrile. She has a history of long-standing irritable bowel symptoms and has not taken any pharmacotherapy. Vital signs are: temperature 37.3C (99.2F), pulse 84/min and regular and respirations 12/min. On physical examination the abdomen is tender in the left lower quadrant; there is no rebound tenderness and bowel sounds are normal. Leukocyte count is 10,200 with 71% segmented neutrophils and 3% band forms. The patient is sent home on a liquid diet and tetracycline therapy. Three days later she returns because the pain has become worse and she is now having chills. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?  ","Admit her to the hospital and begin cefoxitin therapy, intravenously",Admit her to the hospital and prepare her for an immediate operation,"Change to ciprofloxacin therapy, orally, and send her home",Continue the present course of therapy,Do colonoscopy,,1,"The patient described has diverticulosis leading to diverticulitis. You must start antibiotics that cover the gram-positive cocci, gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes found in the abdomen. Cefoxitin fits the bill. Immediate surgery is too aggressive, particularly without even an attempt at antibiotic therapy. Ciprofloxacin is inappropriate as it has poor gram-positive coverage and no anaerobic coverage. Continuing the present therapy is incorrect because the worsening pain and chills imply infection. Colonoscopy is dangerous in diverticulitis because it can lead to perforation.",,
1097,3,PMCH,"A 55 year old man with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease returns to the office following a recent evaluation for possible lung transplantation in another city. He says he had been considered a suitable candidate, in all respects, but was rejected by the transplant program when a random urine test was positive for a nicotine metabolite. He had previously told you that he had stopped smoking 3 years ago. He stands by this and is at a loss to explain the positive urine test. He wants to know what he should do now. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?  ",Advise him again to stop smoking and refer him to another transplant program,"Advise him that the transplant program cannot turn him down on this basis, according to the Disabilities Act",Contact the transplant program to learn their reasons for turning him down,Explain to the patient that transplantation is out of the question as a result of what has occurred,Write to the transplant program and insist that they give him another opportunity,,3,"This choice demonstrates that the physician is acting as the patient's advocate, and is accepting his version as the truth. On the other hand, while it is possible that the patient has indeed continued to smoke, this may be insufficient reason to deny him a lung transplant. Contacting the transplant program to determine whether there are other reasons for rejecting the patient as a candidate is appropriate. Advising him to stop smoking implies that the physician does not believe that the patient has already stopped.",,
1098,5,Psychiatry,A 27 year old woman comes to the office because of concerns about sexual function. The patient recently has remarried after being divorced from an abusive partner. She is currently unable to complete intercourse with her new husband due to intense vaginal pain on attempts at penetration. She was able to have intercourse successfully early in her first marriage. She is orgasmic with other stimulation but cannot tolerate digital or other penetration. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism for this condition?  ,Change in vaginal flora because of a new partner,Conversion disorder,Inadequate lubrication,Inflammation of vestibular glands,Vaginal muscle spasm,,5,"The successful completion of intercourse depends on both psychologic and physical factors. Although this patient is the victim of spousal abuse, there is no indication that she is unable to achieve sexual gratification (quite the opposite is true) suggesting that she is physically and psychologically able to achieve orgasm. The issue is rather pain with a specific form of sexual activity: vaginal intercourse. In the absence of other findings such as blood (cervical cancer), this is most likely due to vaginal muscle tension or spasm. A change in vaginal flora may occur depending on the stage of menstruation, infection, antibiotic usage or diet, but this change is not associated with vaginal pain in the absence of vaginal discharge or smell. A conversion disorder is a psychiatric illness whereby physical symptoms are manifest solely as a function of mental illness. As mentioned above, this patient appears to be quite able psychologically to attain orgasm. In addition, conversion disorder, according the DSM IV, has specific diagnostic criteria. Among these is that the symptom or deficit is not limited to pain or sexual dysfunction.",,

She began treatment 6 weeks ago with 50 mg of chlorthalidone daily for mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. The most likely explanation for her symptoms is the development of which of the following? ",Diabetes mellitus,Hypokalemia,Hypomagnesemia,Hyponatremia,Metabolic acidosis,,2,"Hypokalemia is a very common side effect of nonpotassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., chlorthalidone). This is often more pronounced in the older age group. Patients usually complain of muscle weakness, fatigue, and cramps. Constipation and ileus characterize the smooth muscle involvement, whereas hyporeflexia, flaccid paralysis, and tetany are signs of severe hypokalemia.",,
1100,4,Pediatrics,"A 6 year old boy is brought to the office by his mother because of the gradual onset of abdominal pain. On physical examination today the child does not appear to be in acute distress. Abdominal examination discloses normal bowel sounds and no tenderness, and is otherwise inconclusive. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?  ",Ask the mother about problems separately from her son,Call the school to check on details of the onset of pain,Do rectal examination,Obtain serum liver chemistry profile,Order supine x-ray film of the abdomen,,1,"It is important to differentiate whether the patient's abdominal pain is due to an underlying organic, psychogenic, or functional cause. A full history must be taken to determine the nature and characteristics of the pain and any associated symptoms. The initial interview should be performed with the entire family together; however, the patient and parents should then be interviewed separately. At this point, the physician may be able to discern if the abdominal pain is a manifestation of a stress in the home or school environment. The patient may also be more forthcoming when interviewed alone, and may verbalize any fears or complaints more easily.",,

Following this treatment, his privilege to practice medicine will be determined by which of the following?  ",RCPSC or CFPC,Credentials committee of his hospital,Provincial medical board,He will not be permitted to practice,,,3,"Depending upon the specialty of medicine and the province in which the physician practices, provincial medical board determines whether a physician known to have abused narcotics can practice medicine again. In anesthesia, for example, a rehabilitated physician can no longer practice anesthesia, but may continue to practice in another specialty. These regulations vary widely from province to province and from profession to profession. The key factor is the successful completion of a board-mandated drug rehabilitation program. The provincial medical board determines his privilege to practice.",,
1102,1,Medicine,A 70 year old woman returns to the office because of aching and weakness in her arms to the point where she cannot lift her arm to brush her hair. Physical examination shows no muscle tenderness or other evidence of joint disease in both arms. The aching improves when she takes the prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). She also describes tenderness over the right temporal area of her scalp. Physical examination of the scalp shows no lesions. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?  ,Increase the dose of the NSAID,Order determination of erythrocyte sedimentation rate,Order determination of serum rheumatoid factor,Order x-ray films of the cervical spine,Refer her for psychiatric counseling,,2,"The tenderness over the right temporal area of the patient's scalp is worrisome for temporal arteritis, which is often associated with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Prompt treatment with steroids is often indicated to prevent blindness. The diagnosis can be established with a temporal artery biopsy. Increasing her dose of NSAIDs is incorrect. The most common treatments for pain are the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. If this is ineffective, oral steroids such as prednisone should be started. Since this patient does not have signs or symptoms consistent with any type of arthritis (no joint disease; arthritis is a disease of joints), a serum RF is not useful. A radiograph of the cervical spine is not indicated here as this patient does not describe radicular symptoms that could be attributed to compression of single nerve root. Rather, her symptoms are of generalized weakness. This is not a symptom that a cervical disc could be responsible for.",,
1103,1,Medicine,A 34 year old laborer comes to the office because of a 2-kg (5-lb) weight loss and an increased appetite. He has diabetes mellitus and has been taking insulin in divided doses. He says that home monitoring of his serum glucose concentration has shown values from 280 mg/dL to 320 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate management? ,Add metformin,Change to another type of insulin,Increase his caloric intake,Increase his insulin dose,Redistribute his caloric intake,,4,"This patient has inadequately treated insulin-dependent diabetes. The goal serum glucose for therapy is &lt; 120 mg/dL. Since there is no indication that the insulin type is incorrect (hypoglycemia), the patient simply requires an increased dosage of his current insulin type. Metformin is an oral antihyperglycemic agent that acts by increasing peripheral utilization of glucose. The primary purpose of medications such as this is to delay or avoid the requirement for exogenous insulin. Once a patient is on insulin, these drugs are of little benefit. Secondarily, most patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes have relative &ldquo;insulin resistance&rdquo; and it is for this reason that glucose utilization drugs are employed as first line management. This patient's symptoms of increased weight loss and appetite are a function of his poor glucose control, not of inadequate caloric intake. Poorly controlled insulin dependent diabetics are often thin as they waste muscle to liberate glucose in an attempt to provide glucose for the body. The defect is with the inability to utilize the glucose already present so the end result is hyperglycemia and muscle wasting. For similar reasons, there is no need to alter his caloric distribution.",,

On examination of the pelvis there is a diffuse erythematous rash extending over the perineum and the medial thighs bilaterally. You suspect the rash relates to urinary incontinence. Which of the following is the most appropriate statement to the daughter?  ",&quot;How long have you left your mother in this condition?&quot;,&quot;His is a rash caused by urine.

This patient has dialysis dependent renal failure and very specific social constraints on her ability to receive therapy. For this reason, the initiation of dialysis at home would suit both her medical needs and her social needs. Physicians do not make decisions about excluding patients from care based upon social, financial or any other factor. Physicians present to their patients all of the options for their care and assist the patient in making the best decision for them. The physician acts as the patient advocate. If the patient refuses dialysis after being presented with that option by her physician, that is her right. Peritoneal dialysis is an option for this patient, but generally, hemodialysis is utilized first for a number of reasons. Once patients have exhausted access to their circulation, or they have a specific contra-indication to hemodialysis, a peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter can be placed and PD can be utilized.",,

These flare-ups usually continue until the time between flare-ups is briefer and briefer, and the symptoms are worse each time. Some flare-ups last only a few days; some last for weeks. The joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis have a membrane, called the synovial membrane, that produces synovial fluid to keep the joints lubricated and to help the bones move smoothly around the joint. When the synovial membrane becomes stiff and thick, it becomes difficult to move the joint. Joint pain and stiffness is usually worse first thing in the morning. Other symptoms include redness and warmth around the affected joint, low fever, appetite and weight loss, and fatigue. Eventually, the joint becomes deformed, the cartilage is destroyed, and the unprotected bone begins to wear away. The joints can become 'stuck' in one position, called contractures.

Reticulocytosis occurs in hemolytic anemia.",,
1124,1,Medicine,"Hemolytic anemia is characterized by all of the following, except: ",Increased LDH,Increased reticulocytosis,Increased unconjugated bilirubin,Increased haptoglobin,,,4,"Hemolysis presents as acute or chronic anemia, reticulocytosis, or jaundice. The diagnosis is established by reticulocytosis, increased unconjugated bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase, decreased haptoglobin, and peripheral blood smear findings. Premature destruction of erythrocytes occurs intravascularly or extravascularly. The etiologies of hemolysis often are categorized as acquired or hereditary. Common acquired causes of hemolytic anemia are autoimmunity, microangiopathy, and infection. Immune-mediated hemolysis, caused by antierythrocyte antibodies, can be secondary to malignancies, autoimmune disorders, drugs, and transfusion reactions.",,
1125,6,Surgery,"A patient complains of a non-tender mass over the thyroid region on the left side of her neck. Concerned about a thyroid disorder, you order the appropriate investigations. The results are as follows:TSH: 6.0Free T4: 20.2Thyroid antibodies: noneRAIU (radioactive iodine uptake): No &ldquo;hot&rdquo; spots seenThe next investigation you choose to do is",Watch and wait for 3-6 months,FNA,Surgical biopsy,Trial of L-thyroxine therapy for 6 months,,,2,"Initial evaluation of a thyroid nodule consists of TSH, free T4, and antithyroid peroxidase antibody measurements. Ultrasound is useful in determining the size of the nodule but is rarely diagnostic of cancer. Thyroid cancer is suggested by ultrasound or radiographic evidence of fine, stippled calcification (papillary carcinoma) or dense, homogeneous calcification (medullary carcinoma). Thyroid isotopic scanning is obtained if TSH is suppressed; nodules with increased radionuclide uptake (hot) are seldom malignant. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is the best diagnostic approach for distinguishing benign from malignant nodules and is performed if initial thyroid function tests do not indicate hyperthyroidism or Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Early use of fine-needle aspiration biopsy is a more economic approach than routine use of ultrasound and radioiodine scans. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is not routinely indicated for nodules &lt; 1 cm on ultrasonography.",,
1126,4,Pediatrics,"An 8 year old boy is brought to the office because his mother is concerned he is entering puberty already. You examine him and note the beginnings of facial hair, axillary hair and Tanner stage 2 external genitalia. If you suspect premature adrenarche, which of the following would you want to order: ",Testosterone,DHEA and DHEA-S,Bone age X ray,Urinary 17-ketosteroids,All of the above,,5,"Premature adrenarche refers to the precocious secretion of adrenal androgens, which results in the isolated development of pubic hair (pubarche) before the age of eight years in girls and nine years in boys. The female to male ratio is approximately 10:1. The condition is characterized by activation of adrenal androgen production and by impressive increases in dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), androstenedione, and testosterone.Serum concentrations of DHEA, DHEAS, androstenedione, and testosterone and urinary 17-ketosteroids should be measured. In premature adrenarche, these levels are usually increased for chronologic age and are in the range of those found in early puberty. A bone age x-ray should be preformed. In premature adrenarche, the bone age is usually within 2 standard deviations of chronologic age.Moderately elevated levels of serum androgen other than DHEAS, bone age advancement, or signs of atypical premature pubarche such as cystic acne or signs of systemic virilization indicate the need for an ACTH test to rule out congenital adrenal hyperplasia. An excessive increase in serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone level to 45 nmol/L after an ACTH stimulation test suggests late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia.Marked elevation of serum androgen levels and advanced bone age suggest the possibility of an adrenocortical or gonadal tumor. A patient with an androgen-producing adrenocortical tumor does not respond to ACTH stimulation or dexamethasone suppression, whereas a patient with congenital adrenal hyperplasia does respond. ",,

The most likely diagnosis is ",Scabies,Atopic dermatitis,Contact dermatitis,Shingles,Dyshydrotic eczema,,2,"Dermatitis is an inflammation of the skin that may cause dryness, flaking, and itching. Atopic means this type of dermatitis is related to or caused by a hereditary predisposition toward certain hypersensitivity reactions, such as asthma or hay fever, when exposed to specific triggers called antigens. Atopic dermatitis can occur in both children and adults, and sometimes first appears during infancy. Atopic dermatitis often affects people with a family history of allergies. Atopic dermatitis is linked with asthma and hay fever. These conditions often run together in a family. Atopic dermatitis leads to itching and redness, and may make the skin dry and flaky. Sometimes itchy blisters form. The surface of the skin may become moist and crusty if these blisters burst, or when scratching damages the skin. Atopic dermatitis is often worse in the folds of the skin where the limbs bend. The itch is intense, but scratching only makes the symptoms worse.",,

A general centripetal eruption of 0.5- to 2-cm rose- or fawn-colored oval papules and plaques follows within 7 to 14 days. The lesions have a scaly, slightly raised border (collarette) and resemble ringworm (tinea corporis). Most patients itch, occasionally severely. Papules may dominate with little or no scaling in blacks, children, and pregnant women; the rose or fawn color is not as evident in blacks; blacks also more commonly have inverse PR (lesions in the axillae or groin that spread centrifugally). Classically, lesions orient along skin lines, giving PR a Christmas treelike distribution when multiple lesions appear on the back. A prodrome of malaise and headache precedes the lesions in a minority of patients. Diagnosis is based on clinical appearance and distribution.",,

See picture:She states that a few weeks prior she had some chapped lips with occasional bleeding. Now, the lips have healed but this lesion arose suddenly in its place. It is occasionally tender on pressure. The most likely diagnosis is: ",HSV1,Cherry hemangioma,Pyogenic granuloma,Dermal nevus,,qe352.jpg,3,"Pyogenic granuloma can occur at any mucosal location of acute or chronic trauma, or infection. In the mouth the vast majority of these very common lesions occur on the gingiva, where they may develop as dumb-bell shaped masses on the facial and lingual surfaces of the dental arch, connected by a thin isthmus between adjacent teeth. Other sites of common involvement include the tongue, the lip mucosa and vermilion, and the buccal mucosa. All ages and both genders are susceptible to this exuberant inflammatory response. The lesion is usually a pedunculated, bright red mass with or without white areas of surface ulceration; some lesions have a normal coloration. Rarely does pyogenic granuloma exceed 2.5 cm. in size and it usually reaches its full size within weeks or months, remaining indefinitely thereafter.",,

Which diagnosis best fits the scenario? ",Polycystic kidney disease,Chronic glomerulonephritis,Multiple myeloma,Diabetic nephropathy,Analgesic abuse,,3,"Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of plasma cells that produce monoclonal immunoglobulin and invade and destroy adjacent bone tissue. Common manifestations include bone pain, renal insufficiency, hypercalcemia, anemia, and recurrent infections. Persistent bone pain (especially in the back or thorax), renal failure, and recurring bacterial infections are the most common presentations. Pathologic fractures are common, and vertebral collapse may lead to spinal cord compression and paraplegia. Symptoms of anemia predominate or may be the sole reason for evaluation in some patients, and a few have manifestations of hyperviscosity syndrome. Diagnosis requires demonstration of M-protein (sometimes present in urine and not serum) and either lytic bone lesions, light-chain proteinuria, or excessive marrow plasma cells. A bone marrow biopsy is usually needed.",,

Blood tests can tell how much damage has been done to the kidneys. The most important things a patient can do to control the progression of their diabetes is to keep blood pressure lower than 130 over 80. Keep HbA1C level below 7 percent and leading a balance lifestyle with diet and exercise.,,
1134,3,PMCH,The various species of Campylobacter can cause diseases ranging from acute enteritis to bacteremia. Which of the following modes of transmission does not apply to Campylobacter? ,Contact with infected animals,Contaminated food and water,Improperly cooked poultry,Aerolized droplets,Person to person spread via fecal-oral route,,4,"Campylobacter are motile, curved, microaerophilic, gram-negative bacilli that normally inhabit the GI tract of many domestic animals and fowl. Several species are human pathogens. Most cause diarrhea in all age groups, although peak incidence appears to be from age 1 to 5 years. Campylobacter accounts for more cases of diarrhea than Salmonella and Shigella combined. C. fetus and several others typically cause bacteremia in adults, more often when underlying predisposing diseases, such as diabetes, cirrhosis, or malignancy, are present. Contact with infected animals and ingestion of contaminated food (especially undercooked poultry) or water have been implicated in outbreaks. However, for sporadic cases, the source of the infecting organism frequently is obscure. There is an association between summer outbreaks of C. jejuni diarrheal illness and subsequent development (up to 30% of cases) of Guillain-Barr syndrome.The most common presentation is watery and sometimes bloody diarrhea. Fever (38 to 40 C), which follows a relapsing or intermittent course, is the only constant feature of systemic Campylobacter infection, although abdominal pain and hepatosplenomegaly are frequent.",,

Congenital heart block, an important manifestation of neonatal lupus syndrome (NLE) that carries a poor prognosis, may merit preventive therapy in pregnancy during fetal cardiac development. It should be considered in pregnant women with systemic lupus erythematosus who are anti-SSA/Ro antibody positive and have previous children with congenital heart block. A general management plan of pregnancy in mothers with systemic lupus erythematosus includes treatment of disease flares using drugs that are effective but also safe for the fetus. Such an approach may diminish or reduce the prevalence of complete heart block associated with NLE. Corticosteroids and some immunosuppressive drugs are sometimes used, but long-term outcome data in children exposed to immunosuppressive drugs in utero is lacking.",,

Anticoagulation with heparin and then subsequently with oral anticoagulation is initiated. The duration of anticaogulation in patients without the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is generally 3-6 months. In patients with the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, the risk of recurrence is relatively high for both arterial and venous thrombotic events. As a result, patients are generally started on long-term (in some cases life-long) oral anticoagulation.The treatment of women who are pregnant and have the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome can result in a much higher success rate for the pregnancy. Several regimens have been studied including heparin.",,
1143,1,Medicine,Which is more often associated with hospital acquired pneumonia than community acquired pneumonia? ,Streptococcus pneumoniae,Hemophilus influenza,Legionella,Chlamydia pneumoniae,Mycoplasma pneumoniae,,3,"Legionella pneumophila most often causes pneumonia, with extrapulmonary features. Diagnosis requires specific growth media, serologic testing, or PCR analysis. Treatment is with doxycycline, macrolides, or fluoroquinolones. The 1st appearance of this organism was in 1976 at a convention of the American Legion, thus the name Legionnaires' disease. Nonpneumonic infection is called Pontiac fever. The organisms can be found in soil and freshwater. Manufactured water-storage containers, including water-cooled air-conditioning units, enhance its growth. Spread is most likely by aerosols of potable water.Legionnaires' disease is a flu-like syndrome with acute fever, chills, malaise, myalgias, headache, or confusion.

1159,1,Medicine,A 30 year old patient with asthma complains of daily wheezing and occasional waking at night with cough and chest tightness for three weeks. His usual medication is salbutamol two puffs tid-qid. The next step in management is: ,Add long-term theophylline,Increase salbutamol to two puffs q4h,Add ipratropium bromide two puffs qid,Add beclomethasone two puffs qid,Discontinue salbutamol and begin prednisone 50 mg and taper over 2 weeks,,4,"Stage one of asthma is when a patient has symptoms 2 or less times per week. For these patients the use of a short acting beta agonist (eg albuterol, salbutamol) on an as needed basis is recommended. Stage two of asthma is when a patient has symptoms greater than twice a week. At this point you must add as inhaled steroid (eg fluticasone, beclomethasone) to the patients treatment. Some physicians will also add a nighttime dose of singulair.",,
1160,1,Medicine,A 63 year old woman develops intermittent dizziness. Examination discloses abnormal corneal reflex and mild hearing loss in the right ear. The most likely diagnosis is:  ,Cerebellopontine angle tumour,Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo,Lateral medullary syndrome,Mnire disease,,,1,"Cerebellopontine angle tumour is a benign tumour of the 8th cranial nerve that affects approximately 1 out of 100,000 people. This tumour arises from the myelin forming Schwann cells that coat the 8th cranial nerve (acoustic nerve). Clinical presentation usually includes diminished corneal reflex and a hearing deficit. Diagnosis can be made with auditory evoked potentials and/or MRI scanning of the brain. Vertigo and tinnitus may be associated symptoms. Surgical removal of this tumour involves dissection, cautery and obliteration with laser. Causes: acoustic neuroma (90%), meningioma (7%), epidermoid (3%), uncommon: metastasis, trigeminal neuroma, arachnoid cyst and aneurysm.",,
1161,1,Medicine,Which of the following would not be expected in a right-sided Brown-Squard syndrome? ,Right-sided hemi-paresis,Right-sided loss of proprioception,Left-sided decreased sensitivity to pinprick,Left-sided decreased vibration sense,Right-sided hyperactive deep tendon reflexes,,4,"Brown-Sequard syndrome (BSS) is a rare neurological condition characterized by a lesion in the spinal cord which results in weakness or paralysis (hemiparaplegia) on one side of the body and a loss of sensation (hemianesthesia) on the opposite side. In addition, loss of proprioception, spastic paralysis, and hyperactive deep tendon reflexes develop ipsilaterally (same side). BSS may be caused by a spinal cord tumor, trauma (such as a puncture wound to the neck or back), ischemia (obstruction of a blood vessel), or infectious or inflammatory diseases such as tuberculosis, or multiple sclerosis.",,
1162,3,PMCH,"A 37 year old married man who is a patient in your practice comes to the office because of low back pain. After you enter the examining room and establish rapport, he appears embarrassed and says that back pain is not why he is here. Upon further questioning, he admits to a sexual encounter on a recent business trip and says he now has a greenish urethral discharge. Tests for gonorrhea are positive. He admits to having exposed his wife since returning from the trip. He does not want his wife to know about this. Because his wife is also a patient in your practice, which of the following is the most ethical approach?  ","Without telling him, report the case to the state health department and let them handle contacting his wife",Request that he inform his wife of her exposure and the need for treatment and offer to assist as necessary,Suggest that he bring his wife to the office tomorrow so that you can explain the situation and the need for treatment for both of them,"Telephone his wife after he leaves, inform her of the problem and request that she come to the office for treatment",Treat him now and treat his wife when she comes to the office for her next annual Pap smear 2 weeks from now,,2,"Although emotion may suggest a proper course of action during such a clinical scenario, the issues are clear, and therefore, so is the course of action. This patient has requested that his medical condition not be discussed with anyone, including his wife. Therefore, the most that can be done is for proper clinical advice to be offered to the patient. Making yourself available as needed for your patient and offering a method by which he could inform his wife are both appropriate adjunctive measures.",,
1163,3,PMCH,"A 31 year old man comes to the office because he is concerned about his relationship with his young son. The father says that they always have been very close, but recently he has not had much energy to spend quality time with his son. He does not understand why he has had this change in behavior. He says he feels well, and to his knowledge, is healthy. He says that he works daily in a job he likes and has had no occupational problems. History and physical examination lead you to suspect substance abuse. Abuse of which of the following substances would most likely explain his behavior?  ",Amphetamine,Cocaine,Marijuana,Phencyclidine,,,3,"The cardinal symptom reported by this patient is fatigue (lack of energy). Of the substances listed, marijuana is most likely to produce that symptom. The characteristic signs of abuse of this drug are fatigue, lethargy, and somnolence. Amphetamine is a stimulant that acts via indirect release of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) from adrenergic nerve terminals. It is associated with excess energy and with prolonged use, psychosis. Cocaine is also a stimulant. It acts via inhibition of catecholamine (dopamine and norepinephrine) synaptic reuptake and therefore prolongs the availability of these transmitters in the synaptic cleft. Cocaine usage is associated with a profound sense of euphoria, energy and mania. Phencyclidine also known as PCP is a hallucinogen. The symptoms of abuse of this drug are clear and relate to hallucinations and delusions.",,
1164,2,OBGYN,"A 31 year old woman who is 18 weeks pregnant with her third child comes to the office for a routine prenatal visit. She has used crack cocaine on and off throughout this pregnancy. You have encouraged her to seek help, however, she has made no attempt to abstain from using cocaine and she refuses to commit herself to another drug treatment program. In your attempt to persuade this patient to stop using cocaine, you advise her that if she continues to use cocaine during the pregnancy, she increases her risk for which of the following?  ",Chorioamnionitis,Gestational diabetes,Placental abruption,Placenta previa,Preeclampsia,,3,"Cocaine toxicity results from its intensive activation of the sympathetic nervous system, producing vasoconstriction and hypertension. Vasoconstriction produces decreased placental perfusion and placental insufficiency. Hypertension may result in placental abruption. There may be coexisting factors contributing to placental abruption in cocaine addicts. In addition to an increased risk of abruption, there is an increased incidence of congenital anomalies, particularly of the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts, when cocaine has been abused during pregnancy. This fact may also be used in a persuasive manner to convince the patient to discontinue her abuse of cocaine. Other potential risks to the cocaine-abusing gravida include premature labor, premature delivery, and intrauterine growth retardation. If a patient refuses treatment, continued visits and inquiries about substance abuse are appropriate. Any positive efforts by the patient to discontinue use should be encouraged. Documentation of referral efforts and the fact that the patient was informed about the effects of illicit drugs on the pregnancy should be made. There is no effective chemical detoxification or replacement therapy for cocaine addicts. Treatment emphasizes abstinence and psychosocial counseling.",,
1165,4,Pediatrics,"During a sports physical examination, a 14 year old boy expresses concern about his height. He was in the 15th percentile for height throughout childhood and now is just above the 10th percentile. His sexual maturation rating is Tanner stage 2 for both genitalia and pubic hair. He should be told which of the following? ",He is near his final height,He probably has a slight deficiency of growth hormone,He should increase his daily caloric intake,He will grow several more inches,He will need testosterone injections for several months,,4,"Tanner staging reveals information about pubertal development. Testicular enlargement is usually the first sign of pubertal development. Most boys reach adult height during the latter half of puberty (Tanner stage 4). Since this boy's rating is Tanner stage 2, there is evidence that he will probably grow several more inches in height. Since this is the case, there is no indication that he is near his final height has a deficiency in growth hormone, should increase his daily caloric intake or that he will need testosterone injections.",,
1166,6,Surgery,"A 15 year old boy presents with a swollen and painful left ear. The boy's ear has been black and blue since he injured it in a wrestling match 3 days ago. Symptoms have increased significantly following a repeat injury 3 hours ago. On physical examination, his left ear is markedly swollen and tender to palpation. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?  ",Reassure him and start aspirin therapy,Reassure him and start codeine therapy,Recommend that he apply cold packs to the ear for the next 12 hours,Recommend that he apply hot packs to the ear for the next 12 hours,Refer him to a surgeon for immediate drainage of the lesion,,5,"This boy has two of the cardinal findings of inflammation: dolor and tumor (pain and swelling), the others, rubor (redness), calor (heat) and functio lata (loss of function) are also important to look for on exam. Since it is clear that the child has an active infection, the best answer choice of the ones given is to refer him to a surgeon for surgical drainage. Reassuring him and starting aspirin (an anti-inflammatory agent) or codeine (a pain therapy) fails to address the etiology, and in fact, may simply mask the underlying process. It is critical to not treat symptoms unless management of the underlying issues is also addressed. Applying cold or hot packs to the ear are again, a symptom based management strategy. This may provide some analgesia and respite from the process, but the underlying etiology, in this case an infection, will go untreated and will likely progress.",,
1167,1,Medicine,"A 68 year old woman presents with a band-like burning pain in the right upper quadrant extending from the epigastrium around to the midline of the back. On physical examination, there is no abdominal tenderness. Findings on ultrasonography of the gallbladder are normal, serum amylase concentration is normal. The most likely diagnosis is:  ",Acalculous cholecystitis,Chronic relapsing pancreatitis,Diverticulitis of the cecum,Herpes zoster,Penetrating duodenal ulcer,,4,"Herpes zoster (shingles) is characterized by a vesicular rash that is preceded by the bandlike burning pain described here. It usually involves only one or two dermatomes. It is always a reactivation/flare-up of a previous Varicella infection. In this patient, there is no abdominal tenderness, which decreases the likelihood of an intra-abdominal organ being involved. Acalculous cholecystitis is a diagnosis made more commonly in the ICU. The patient is usually post-op, in shock, or critically ill. Chronic relapsing pancreatitis is characterized by a boring or cramping epigastric pain radiating to the back. It is more commonly seen in alcoholics, who will have some abdominal tenderness. Amylase and lipase levels may support the diagnosis if they come back high.",,
1168,4,Pediatrics,"An 18 month old infant is brought to the clinic because of pallor and irritability. Her mother says the infant's diet consists almost exclusively of whole milk, approximately 40 oz per day.

Laboratory studies show: Hematocrit 13%Hemoglobin 3 g/dLMean corpuscular volume 48 &micro;m3Platelet count 400,000/mm3Following appropriate evaluation, which of the following is the most appropriate treatment? ",Administration of oral folate therapy,Administration of parenteral iron therapy,Administration of parenteral vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) therapy,Transfusion with packed erythrocytes,Transfusion with whole blood,,4,"Starting transfusion with packed erythrocytes is the most appropriate management because this patient has severe iron deficiency anemia. Pallor is the most important clue to iron deficiency anemia. However, patients may also have other symptoms such as tachycardia, tachypnea, heart murmurs, and hepatomegaly. In patients with hemoglobin under 4 g/dL, a blood transfusion with packed erythrocytes should be given slowly. The quantity of packed erythrocytes administered should be sufficient to raise the level of hemoglobin to a safe level while awaiting the response to iron therapy.",,

It produces fever, heart murmurs, petechiae, anemia, embolic phenomena, and endocardial vegetations. Vegetations may result in valvular incompetence or obstruction, myocardial abscess, or mycotic aneurysm. Infective endocarditis occurs most often on the left side (eg, mitral or aortic valve). About 10 to 20% of cases are right-sided (tricuspid or pulmonic valve). IV drug abusers have a much higher incidence of right-sided endocarditis (about 30 to 70%).Diagnosis requires demonstration of microorganisms in blood and usually echocardiography. Treatment consists of prolonged antimicrobial treatment and sometimes surgery.",,

SBP is particularly common in cirrhotic ascites, especially in alcoholics. It can produce serious sequelae or death. The most common bacteria causing SBP are the gram-negative Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and the gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae; usually only a single organism is involved.",,
1171,1,Medicine,Which finding is not frequently found in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)? ,Elevated WBCs,Elevated vitamin B12 level,Elevated LDH,Translocation between chromosomes 9 and 14,Increased uric acid level,,4,"The diagnosis of CML is suspected based on the results of a simple blood test. The test may show an abnormally high white blood cell count. In blood samples examined under a microscope, less mature white blood cells, normally found only in bone marrow, are seen.Tests that analyze chromosomes (cytogenetics or molecular genetics) are needed to confirm the diagnosis. Chromosomal analysis of the leukemia cells always shows a rearrangement of two particular chromosomes into what is called the Philadelphia chromosome. The Philadelphia chromosome produces an abnormal enzyme (tyrosine kinase), which is responsible for the abnormal growth pattern of the white blood cells in CML.Philadelphia chromosome or Philadelphia translocation is a specific chromosomal abnormality that is associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). It is due to a reciprocal translocation designated as t(9;22) which means an exchange of genetic material between chromosome 9 and chromosome 22.",,

Schistocytes can be seen in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), micropathic hemolytic anemia, glomerulonephritis, and hemolytic anemia resulting from mechanical trauma to the red blood cells (such as severe burns).In thalassemia the peripheral blood smear typically shows hypochromia, microcytosis, and target cells.",,
1173,1,Medicine,Which of the following is true of Myasthenia Gravis? ,Thymic hypoplasia is well recognized in myasthenic patients.,Can be associated with autoimmune thyroiditis,Antibodies that are produced against acetylcholinesterase,Associated with small cell lung carcinoma,,,2,"Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder of episodic muscle weakness and easy fatigability caused by antibody- and cell-mediated destruction of acetylcholine receptors. It is more common among young women and older men but may occur at any age. Symptoms worsen with muscle activity and lessen with rest. Diagnosis is by IV edrophonium challenge, which briefly lessens the weakness. Treatment includes anticholinesterase drugs, immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, thymectomy, and plasmapheresis. Once myasthenia is diagnosed, CT or MRI of the thorax should be done to check for a thymoma. Other tests should be done to screen for autoimmune disorders frequently associated with myasthenia gravis (eg, vitamin B12 deficiency, hyperthyroidism, RA, SLE).Immunogenic mechanisms play important roles in the pathophysiology of myasthenia gravis. Supporting clinical observations include the presence of associated autoimmune disorders in patients suffering from myasthenia gravis (eg, autoimmune thyroiditis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis). The importance of T cells in pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis is becoming increasingly apparent. The thymus is the central organ in T cellmediated immunity, and thymic abnormalities such as thymic hyperplasia or thymoma are well recognized in myasthenic patients.  ",,
1174,1,Medicine,"All of the following are treatments for physiological non-scarring alopecia, except:",Spironolactone,Minoxidil,Hair transplantation,Long-acting oral tetracycline,Finasteride,,4,"Most treatments for hair loss have been developed for male-pattern baldness because it is so prevalent. Minoxidil prolongs the anagen phase and may increase blood flow to the follicle; 1 mL of 2% or 5% topical drug applied bid to the scalp is most effective for vertex alopecia in male-pattern baldness affecting men or women. However, at most 30 to 40% of patients experience significant hair growth, and minoxidil is generally not effective or indicated for other causes except possibly alopecia areata. Finasteride inhibits 5- reductase enzyme, blocking conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, and is useful for male-pattern baldness. Finasteride 1 mg po once/day stimulates scalp hair growth. Hormonal modulators such as oral contraceptives or spironolactone may be useful for female-pattern hair loss associated with hyperandrogenemia.Surgical options include follicle transplant, scalp flaps, and alopecia reduction. Few procedures have been subjected to scientific scrutiny, but patients who are self-conscious about their hair loss may consider them.Scarring alopecia as seen in central centrifugal scarring alopecia, dissecting cellulitis of the scalp, and acne keloidalis nuchae is best treated by a long-acting oral tetracycline in combination with a potent topical corticosteroid.

1175,1,Medicine,A 70 year old woman presents with acute knee arthritis. Radiographs show meniscal calcification (chondrocalcinosis). Analysis of the synovial fluid reveals weakly positive birefringent rhomboid-shaped crystals. The crystals are most likely: ,Monosodium urate,Calcium hydroxyapatite,Cholesterol,Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate,,,4,"Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease involves intra-articular and/or extra-articular deposition of CPPD crystals. Manifestations are protean and may be minimal or include intermittent attacks of acute arthritis and a degenerative arthropathy that is often severe. Diagnosis requires identification of CPPD crystals in synovial fluid. Diagnosis is established by identifying rhomboid or rod-shaped, weakly positively birefringent crystals on polarized light microscopy of synovial fluid.",,
1176,1,Medicine,A 25 year old woman presents with intense itching due to a rash that started yesterday. She denies any insect bites or recent exposure to anything new. You believe this is a self-limited case of pruritus and decide to treat symptomatically. Which of the following is an appropriate choice? ,Permethrin,Lindane,Dexamethasone,Hydroxyzine,Prednisone,,4,"Pruritus (itching) can be a symptom of primary skin diseases or of systemic disease. Skin diseases notorious for causing intense pruritus include scabies, pediculosis, insect bites, urticaria, atopic and contact dermatitis, lichen planus, miliaria, and dermatitis herpetiformis.Topical agents may help localized pruritus. Options include camphor/menthol lotions and doxepin. Topical diphenhydramine and doxepin should be avoided because they may sensitize the skin. Systemic agents are indicated for generalized pruritus or local pruritus resistant to topical agents. Antihistamines, most notably hydroxyzine are effective and most commonly used.Permethrin and lindane are used in the treatment of scabies. Strong steroids such as prednisone and betamethasone are not required in a self-limited case of pruritus.",,
1177,1,Medicine,"A 35 year old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis comes to the office because she had a sudden loss of vision in the right eye. She has no history of diplopia. On examination, external ocular movements are normal but funduscopic examination shows pallor of the optic disk. This patient's condition is most likely due to demyelination of which of the following?  ",Medial longitudinal fasciculus,Oculomotor nerve,Optic nerve,Trigeminal nerve,Visual cortex,,3,This patient has multiple sclerosis. This is a demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system. The important information about localization of this lesion comes from the history and physical examination. The patient reports loss of vision and exam reveals normal extra-ocular movements with pallor of the optic disk. This is consistent with loss of cranial nerve two (the optic nerve) which conveys sensory information from the retina to the brain.,,
1178,1,Medicine,"A 46 year old woman has had rheumatoid arthritis for 8 years. Her hands now show moderate ulnar deviation of the fingers and she says her wrists and knees also hurt. She says, I had several drop attacks during the past 3 months. She characterizes these attacks as episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes. During one of these episodes, she became incontinent. On physical examination she has facial plethora and swollen and painful metacarpophalangeal and knee joints, bilaterally. The rest of the examination is normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her drop attacks?  ",Adrenal insufficiency,Anxiety,Atlanto-occipital instability,Cardiac arrhythmia,Cerebral ischemia,,3,"Careful attention to her history however allows the diagnosis to ascertained with near certainty. The drop attacks are characterized by incontinence with weakness and loss of feeling in her legs. These symptoms point to a neurologic defect that affects both the parasympathetic and motor functions of the nervous system. Atlanto-occipital joint subluxation is a common problem for patients with advanced rheumatoid arthritis, as this patient clearly suffers from. If the cervical spine were to suffer impingement from such subluxation, it would be expected that motor loss below the level of the impingement aswell as loss of bladder control from interruption of the parasympathetic outflow (cranial component).",,

Since his birth his family has lived in an old area of the city where there is demolition of old buildings. Examination of a peripheral blood smear is likely to show which of the following?  ",Basophilic stippling of erythrocytes,Degranulation of eosinophils,Diminished numbers of platelets,Howell-Jolly bodies,Macrocytic erythrocytes,,1,"This child suffers from lead poisoning. Prior to the 1970s, lead was used in paint, gasoline, water pipes, and many other products. During the demolition of older structures, lead is released and can become ingested by humans, primarily children. Exposure to excessive levels of lead can cause brain damage; affect a child's growth; damage kidneys; impair hearing; cause vomiting, headaches, and appetite loss; and cause learning and behavioral problems. Lead eventually becomes associated with mitochondria in red blood cells and appears as basophilic granules via H &amp; E staining. This is a form of sideroblastic anemia.",,
1180,1,Medicine,A 38 year old woman presents complaining of epigastric pain that is exacerbated by eating. An EGD reveals the presence of a duodenal ulcer. A test for Helicobacter pylori is positive for the H. pylori. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment? ,Metronidazole ,Lansoprazole ,Clarithromycin and Amoxicillin ,Metronidazole and amoxicillin,Lansoprazole and clarithromycin and amoxicillin,,5,"Helicobacter pylori causes duodenal and gastric ulcers. The organism is present in 95% to 100% of patients with duodenal ulcers and in 75% to 85% of those with gastric ulcers. Eradicating the organism generally results in a cure for the disease. H. pylori eradication requires multi-drug therapy, typically antibiotics plus acid suppressants. Proton pump inhibitors suppress H. pylori, and the increased gastric pH accompanying their use can enhance tissue concentration and efficacy of antimicrobials, creating a hostile environment for H. pylori.Triple therapy is recommended. Oral omeprazole 20 mg bid or lansoprazole 30 mg bid, plus clarithromycin 500 mg bid, plus amoxicillin 1 g bid (or, for penicillin-allergic patients, metronidazole 500 mg bid) for 14 days, cures infection in  95% of cases. This regimen has excellent tolerability. Ranitidine bismuth citrate 400 mg po bid may be substituted for the proton pump inhibitor.",,

Laboratory studies show an undetectable level of thyroid-stimulating hormone, an increased level of thyroid hormones, and an increased radioactive iodine uptake. The diagnosis of Graves' disease is made and the treatment options are discussed. The patient selects radioactive iodine therapy. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following conditions?  ",Granulocytopenia,Hypothyroidism,Recurrent laryngeal nerve damage,Thyroid carcinoma,,,2,"Hypothyroidism is the main complication of radioactive iodine therapy, affecting up to 70% of patients in 10 years. Radioactive iodine therapy is a safe and effective treatment for Graves' disease because it can provide the same ablative effects of surgery without the surgical complications. There is no evidence that this treatment increases the risk for carcinoma.",,
1182,1,Medicine,"A 70 year old man complains of increasing urinary frequency and dribbling. On physical examination, a digital rectal exam reveals a normal-sized prostate. The prostate specific antigen level is elevated at 14 ng/mL. Ultrasonography reveals a small hypoechoic area on the prostate measuring 5  9 mm. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?  ",Finasteride,Biopsy of prostate,Repeat PSA in 3 months,Alfuzosin,,,2,"Measurement of serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) can be used to screen for prostate cancer. However, this substance can also be elevated in prostate hypertrophy.

On physical exam his lymph nodes of the axilla of the affected arm are enlarged. Reduced breath sounds and occasional rales are heard. Splenomegaly is noted. He tells you he has handled rabbits recently. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  ",Actinomycosis,Brucellosis,Plague,Tularemia,,,4,"This is tularemia, the causative organism of which is Francisella tularensis. The classic clue in test questions is exposure to rabbits, especially in the wild. Untreated cases tend to last 3 to 4 weeks before resolving. Streptomycin is the antibiotic of choice; gentamicin and chloramphenicol can alternatively be used. Deaths occur in about 6% of untreated cases and are very rare in treated cases.",,

His temperature is 38.3 C (100.9 F), blood pressure is 155/90 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 34/min. He weighs 80 kg. An arterial blood gas reveals a pH of 7.20, a pCO2 of 60 mm Hg, and a pO2 of 52 mm Hg. Over the next 2 hours, he becomes increasingly tachypneic, and his pCO2 rises to 74 mm Hg. The decision is made to intubate him at that point. Which of the following settings would be most appropriate for his tidal volume on the respirator?  ",400 mL/breath,800 mL/breath,1200 mL/breath,1600 mL/breath,,,2,"The tidal volume for a patient is generally estimated as 10 mL/kg of weight, which for this patient would be 800 mL/breath. Giving a lower tidal volume will yield hypoventilation and be insufficient to eliminate pCO2. Providing a tidal volume greater than 10 mL/kg increases the risk of pneumothorax, particularly in a patient with longstanding emphysema who may have thin-walled alveoli.",,

",Karyotype from peripheral leukocytes,Serum estrogen and testosterone concentrations,Follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone,Serum prolactin concentration,Testicular ultrasonography,,1,"This history is typical of Klinefelter syndrome. In Klinefelter, boys have an extra X chromosome. Despite this fact, they are normal in appearance before puberty. After puberty, they have gynecomastia, small and firm testes, and disproportionately long legs and arms. The test most likely to establish the chromosome pattern is karyotype from peripheral leukocytes.",,
1188,4,Pediatrics,"A 5 day old neonate is brought to the office because of the development of yellow skin and a rash 1 day after hospital discharge. She weighed 3400 g (7 lb 8 oz) at birth and is the product of a normal pregnancy. The neonate was breast-feeding and was doing well at the time of discharge. Her skin color has become yellow. On physical examination the neonate weighs 3250 g (7 lb 2 oz). There is scleral and skin icterus. Studies on the neonate show a serum total bilirubin concentration of 8.7 mg/dL, and concentration of serum conjugated (direct) bilirubin is 0.7 mg/dL. The most appropriate advice to give the mother regarding the icterus is to:  ",Ask her to avoid eating foods containing large quantities of carotene,Begin administering small doses of phenobarbital to the neonate,Discontinue breast-feeding until the jaundice has disappeared,Recommend home phototherapy for the neonate,Recommend no change in child care or feeding of the neonate,,5,"Physiologic jaundice is very common in newborns, with a total serum bilirubin concentration of less than 13 mg/dL and a normal direct serum bilirubin concentration. There should be no change in childcare or feeding of the neonate. Phenobarbital is not indicated because this patient has physiologic jaundice and no therapy is required.",,
1189,4,Pediatrics,"A 12 year old girl, who has been undergoing treatment for chronic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis for the past 3 years, is brought to the office because of painful swelling of the right knee. She has had three episodes of painless swelling of her left knee and ankle, which have subsided spontaneously with rest and aspirin therapy. On physical examination today there is pronounced redness and warmth around the right knee, and a large effusion is present. Attempts at active and passive motion cause severe pain. Which of the following is the most appropriate step at this time?  ",99m technetium bone scan,Joint aspiration,Serum antinuclear antibody titer,Serum rheumatoid factor assay,X-ray films of the joint,,2,"Aspiration of the joint should be done in this patient because she has clinical findings suspicious for septic arthritis. These clinical findings include redness and warmth around the knee, large effusion, and pain upon movement of the joint. Diagnostic arthrocentesis should be performed in all patients in whom the diagnosis of septic arthritis is considered. Obtaining a 99mm technetium bone scan may aid in the diagnosis of a septic joint by demonstrating increased soft tissue uptake in the region of the joint. However, this is an aid to diagnosis; the gold standard is the joint aspirate. Obtaining an antinuclear antibody titer would not be helpful, as we already know that this patient has juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), and an ANA depending on the type of JRA may or may not be positive. The focus should be on determining if the knee is septic, only the joint aspirate will give us this information.",,
1190,5,Psychiatry,"A 44 year old housewife and mother of four children (ages 6 to 13 years) has been coming to you for management of tension headaches that have not improved with trials of several appropriate medications. She has been married to a police officer for the past 6 years. You ask if she has been under extra stress, and she begins to cry. You notice bruises on her arms. On further questioning, you learn that her husband hits her whenever he is drunk, which is at least 2 nights per week. Her husband is also a patient of yours. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention?  ",Advise her to leave her home with her children and move in with her relatives,Contact her husband's supervisor to discuss recent stress levels on the job,"Gather more information while remaining neutral, since both the husband and wife are your patients",Refer her to a domestic violence program,Seek a restraining order against her husband on her behalf,,4,"In this case the physician must act as an advocate for this woman. The question clearly describes evidence of physical abuse and an ongoing risk of possible physical harm from this husband. In this regard the physician should refer the patient to a battered women's program much in the same way that a pediatrician would contact the bureau of child welfare if he suspected child abuse. Choices a), c) and e) offer logistical advice that do not directly address protection of the woman. Contacting her husband's supervisor would violate confidentiality. Although both the husband and wife may be patients of this physician, the woman is clearly the individual who is at ongoing risk.",,
1191,2,OBGYN,"A 26 year old woman comes to the office for a gynecologic examination. On physical examination her cervix appears friable with a slight area of ulceration. There are several perineal and vaginal lesions that appear as small &quot;cauliflower-like&quot; projections. The results of the Pap smear, which return in 1 week, show mild dysplasia (LGSIL). Which of the following factors in this patient's history most closely correlates with the abnormal finding on Pap smear?  ",Condylomata acuminata,Condylomata lata,Early age at menarche,History of chlamydia,Nulliparity,,1,"Condyloma acuminata is the physical manifestation of HPV (human papilloma virus), a sexually transmitted disease. There are several serotypes of HPV, with subtypes 6 and 11 causing benign &ldquo;cauliflower-like&rdquo; projections and low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and subtypes 16 and 18 most commonly associated with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and cervical cancer. Condyloma lata is a gray-white highly infectious lesion associated with secondary syphilis; early age at menarche has no correlation with abnormal Pap smear. Early age of menarche and nulliparity has no correlation with abnormal Pap smear. History of chlamydia is a reasonable answer, since chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted cervicitis, but it has not been associated with precancerous dysplasia.",,
1192,1,Medicine,Diagnosis of acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism can be excluded when which of the following is normal? ,Chest x-ray,Ventilation-perfusion lung scan,Bilateral leg venograms,PaO2 and A-a O2 gradient,,,2,"Pulmonary embolism is the occlusion of one or more pulmonary arteries by thrombi that originate elsewhere, typically in the large veins of the lower extremities or pelvis. Risk factors are conditions that impair venous return, conditions that cause endothelial injury or dysfunction, and underlying hypercoagulable states. Symptoms are nonspecific and include dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, and, in severe cases, syncope or cardiorespiratory arrest. Signs are also nonspecific and may include tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, and a loud pulmonic component of the 2nd heart sound. Diagnosis is based on a CT angiogram, ventilation/perfusion scan, or a pulmonary arteriogram.",,
1193,1,Medicine,"In acute pyelonephritis, which of the following is most commonly associated with bacteremic spread from a distant focus? ",Escherichia coli,Proteus,Staphylococcus aureus,Serratia,Enterococcus,,3,"Pyelonephritis is more common in women than in men. Escherichia coli, a type of bacteria normally in the large intestine, causes about 90% of cases of pyelonephritis among people who are not hospitalized or living in a nursing home. Infections usually ascend from the genital area through the urethra to the bladder, up the ureters, into the kidneys. Infections can also be carried to the kidneys from another part of the body through the bloodstream. For instance, a staphylococcal skin infection can spread to the kidneys through the bloodstream.In a person with a healthy urinary tract, an infection is usually prevented from moving up the ureters into the kidneys by the flow of urine washing organisms out and by closure of the ureters at their entrance to the bladder. However, any physical obstruction to the flow of urine, such as a structural abnormality, kidney stone, or an enlarged prostate, or the backflow (reflux) of urine from the bladder into the ureters increases the likelihood of pyelonephritis.

1194,5,Psychiatry,"A 45 year old woman comes to the office for the first time because of recurrent abdominal pain. Review of her extensive medical chart, which she has brought with her, discloses that she has a long history of varying physical complaints. Definitive causes for these complaints have not been found despite extensive diagnostic studies, consultations with many physicians and several surgical explorations. She gives dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her present and past symptoms, and she makes conflicting statements about her history. She has been hospitalized at least 23 times since age 18 years. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  ",Borderline personality disorder,Conversion disorder,Histrionic personality disorder,Occult medical disorder,Somatization disorder,,5,"This patient is over the age of 30, has a history of multiple hospitalizations, and presents with multiple physical complaints, the central feature of somatization disorder. Persons with borderline personality disorder are dramatic; however, the central presentation is not physical complaints but mood lability and intense personal relationships. In conversion disorder there is a stated stressor, and the conversion symptoms are circumscribed and short in duration. Persons with histrionic personality disorder typically seek attention with seductive behavior and emotions, but their central presentation is not usually with physical complaints. Multiple hospitalizations and surgeries are uncommon in individuals with this disorder. After 23 hospitalizations and 32 years of illness, the patient has had enough work-ups to rule out an occult medical disorder.",,
1195,2,OBGYN,"At a routine physical examination, the Pap smear of a 27 year old woman shows evidence of marked inflammation suggestive of moderate dysplasia (HGSIL). Her last Pap smear 2 years ago was normal. Pelvic examination today is normal. She has never been pregnant and her menstrual periods are regular. She has been in a stable relationship with the same man for 3 years and she uses a diaphragm with spermicidal jelly for contraception. The best next step is to:  ",Advise the patient that her partner should use condoms for contraception and repeat the Pap smear in 3 months,Do colposcopic examination of the cervix after application of 5% acetic acid solution,Do conization of the cervix,Reassure the patient and repeat the Pap smear in 3 months,Treat the patient with metronidazole for 2 weeks and repeat the Pap smear in 3 months,,2,"The Papanicolaou smear is a screening test for precancerous cells. Any cervical dysplasia (formerly cervical intraepithelial neoplasia IIII, now low-grade and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) necessitates colposcopy for definitive diagnosis. The diaphragm has not been associated with abnormal Pap smears, so changing the method of contraception would not be of any use. Conization of the cervix is always preceded by a colposcopy, and is indicated for unsatisfactory colposcopy, inconsistency of colposcopic findings with Pap smear findings, an endocervical curettage with abnormal cells, or a lesion on colposcopy extending into the endocervix. Reassurance and repeating the Pap smear in three months can be used for ASCUS (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance); two serial ASCUS Pap smears necessitate colposcopy.",,
1196,1,Medicine,Which of the following is associated with thyroid disease? ,Neurofibromatosis,Vitiligo,Erythema nodosum,Pemphigus vulgaris,Icthyosis vulgaris,,2,"Vitiligo is a loss of skin melanocytes that causes areas of skin depigmentation of varying sizes. Cause is unknown, but the condition may be autoimmune, as up to 1/3 of patients have evidence of other autoimmune disease. Vitiligo affects 0.5 to 2% of the population. Etiology is unknown, but melanocytes are lacking in affected areas; some patients have antibodies to melanin. Up to 30% have other autoimmune antibodies (to thyroglobulin, adrenal cells, and parietal cells) or clinical autoimmune endocrinopathies (Addison's disease, diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia, and thyroid dysfunction), leading to speculation that vitiligo is an autoimmune disease. However, the relationship is unclear and may be coincidental. The strongest association is with hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease) and hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's thyroiditis).",,

Symptoms are productive cough and dyspnea that develop over years; common signs include decreased breath sounds, prolonged expiratory phase of respiration, and wheezing. Long-term O2 therapy prolongs life in COPD patients whose Pao2 is chronically  55 mm Hg. Continual 24-h use is more effective than a 12-h nocturnal regimen. O2 therapy brings Hct toward normal levels; moderately improves neuropsychologic factors, possibly by facilitating sleep; and ameliorates pulmonary hemodynamic abnormalities. O2 therapy also increases exercise tolerance in many patients. Long-term oxygen therapy improves survival by 2-fold or more in hypoxemic patients with COPDnotes:- centriacinar emphysema begins in the respiratory bronchioles and spreads peripherally. Also termed centrilobular emphysema, this form is associated with long-standing cigarette smoking and predominantly involves the upper half of the lungs.- clubbing is an enlargement of the tips of the fingers or toes and a change in the angle where the nails emerge. Clubbing seems to occur with some lung disorders (lung cancer, lung abscess, bronchiectasis), but not with others (pneumonia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Clubbing also occurs with some congenital heart disorders and liver disorders, or in some cases, it may be inherited and not indicate any disorder. Clubbing itself does not need treatment. ",,
1199,1,Medicine,"Nitroglycerin administered sublingually may contribute to the relief of myocardial ischemic pain by each of the following mechanisms, except: ",Coronary vasodilation,Decreased venous pooling resulting in increased cardiac preload,Reduced systemic vascular resistance,Reduced ventricular volume,,,2,"Nitroglycerin, is used to reduce cardiac workload in selected patients. Nitroglycerin dilates veins, arteries, and arterioles, reducing LV preload and afterload. As a result, myocardial O2 demand is reduced, lessening ischemia. IV nitroglycerin is recommended during the first 24 to 48 h for patients with heart failure, large anterior MI, persistent chest discomfort, or hypertension. BP can be reduced by 10 to 20 mm Hg but not to  80 to 90 mm Hg systolic. Longer use may benefit patients with recurrent chest pain or persistent pulmonary congestion. In high-risk patients, nitroglycerin given in the first few hours reduces infarct size and short-term and possibly long-term mortality risk. Nitroglycerin is not routinely given to low-risk patients with uncomplicated MI.",,

He is instructed to come to the office, where urinalysis confirms gross hematuria without proteinuria or casts. The patient denies any pain and is anxious for an explanation. Physical examination is normal. The most appropriate next step is to:  ",Do a transrectal prostatic biopsy,Prescribe a 1 month course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,Schedule bilateral renal angiography,Schedule cystoscopy,Schedule infusion of the renal pelvis with silver nitrate,,4,"Painless hematuria is an important symptom of bladder cancer. When a urinalysis reveals no active sediment indicative of renal damage, the nest most important diagnosis to exclude is bladder cancer. For this reason, a direct visualization of the bladder via cystoscopy is appropriate. A transurethral prostate biopsy is used when prostate enlargement is suspected on the basis of physical examination (enlarged gland via digital exam) or symptoms (hesitancy, post-void dribbling, frequent urinations). The biopsy helps to distinguish between benign hypertrophy and cancer.",,

The mortality rate for falls increases dramatically with age in both sexes and in all racial and ethnic groups, with falls accounting for 70% of accidental deaths in persons 75 years of age and older. Falls can be markers of poor health and declining function, and they are often associated with significant morbidity. More than 90% of hip fractures occur as a result of falls, with most of these fractures occurring in persons over 70 years of age. In persons over age 75, fractures of the lower extremity are about twice as common as fractures of the upper extremity. One third of community-dwelling elderly persons and 60% of nursing home residents fall each year. Risk factors for falls in the elderly include increasing age, medication use, cognitive impairment and sensory deficits.

Sometimes the baby can change positions before labor starts. Sometimes an external version is being done where the baby is manually scooted into a better position. Fetal position is transverse, with the fetal long axis oblique or perpendicular rather than parallel to the maternal long axis. Shoulder-first presentation requires cesarean section unless the fetus is a 2nd twin.

The head:abdominal circumference ratio is &lt; 1. The estimated fetal weight is &lt;10th percentile for 34 weeks gestation. The amniotic fluid is decreased. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ,Symmetrical IUGR,Asymmetrical IUGR,Congenital anomaly,Congenital infection,Unknown gestational age,,2,"Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) is where a baby fails to grow as normal in the womb. These babies are smaller than they should be for their age and their weight is below what it should be for that stage of the pregnancy (below the 10th weight percentile for the baby's age). Babies with IUGR are prone to a variety of problems before and after birth.IUGR can be classified into symmetrical or asymmetrical. In symmetrical IUGR, the baby's head and body are proportionately small. This usually occurs when IUGR begins in early pregnancy. Head circumference, length and weight are all decreased proportionately. These infants are more likely to have significant intrinsic fetal problems than babies where the IUGR begins later.In asymmetrical IUGR, growth restriction is due to problems in late pregnancy (such as maternal renal disease or pre-eclampsia). These babies have a relatively normal head circumference, some reduction in length, but a marked reduction in weight.",,

Fibroids frequently cause abnormal vaginal bleeding (eg, menorrhagia, menometrorrhagia), pelvic pain and pressure, urinary and intestinal symptoms, and pregnancy complications. Diagnosis is by pelvic examination and imaging. Treatment of symptomatic patients depends on the patient's desire for fertility and desire to keep her uterus and may include oral contraceptives, brief presurgical gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy to shrink fibroids, and more definitive surgical procedures (eg, myomectomy, hysterectomy, endometrial ablation). Some pregnant women will have fibroids, some of which occasionally interfere with the normal progress of a pregnancy. Though fibroids tend to grow in size during pregnancy, it is unlikely that they will cause any symptoms. Some pregnant women do experience minor symptoms, particularly pelvic pain and light spotting.The majority of fibroids are of no significance and have no effect upon a woman's fertility, her pregnancy or delivery. Some, however, impinge upon or distort the actual cavity of the uterus and may cause complications in pregnancy, as may a very large fibroid which by virtue of its size distorts the uterus and the other pelvic organs.",,

In advising her about the prognosis, the most accurate statement is: ",Graves ophthalmopathy will resolve as thyroid hormone secretion is lowered,Malignant degeneration of the thyroid is a common complication,She will not be able to become pregnant,The thyroid will continue to increase in size with any nonsurgical treatment,Untreated patients are at increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias,,5,"Hyperthyroid patients are at increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias, typically tachyarrhythmias. Graves' ophthalmopathy follows a course that is independent of thyroid disease. Malignant degeneration is not a complication of Graves disease. Hyperthyroidism does not preclude the ability to become pregnant. There is no evidence to suggest that every Graves thyroid increases in size without surgery.",,
1214,5,Psychiatry,"A 68 year old man with documented alcohol abuse returns to the office because of abdominal pain and bloating. When you meet with him, he appears dejected and his eye contact is poor. Physical examination is normal. Since his last visit, he has moved from the neighborhood where he had lived for 40 years. In addition, he mentions that approximately 6 months ago breast cancer was diagnosed in his wife; she is currently receiving radiation therapy for bony metastases. The most important next step in management of his symptoms is evaluation for  ",Delirium tremens,Gastrointestinal bleeding,Pancreatic carcinoma,Situational anxiety disorder,Suicidal ideation,,5,"Notice in this question that you are being informed of numerous psychosocial stressors for the patient, including growing old, a move from his home of 40 years, and a potentially terminal illness in his wife. A question that enumerates a list of life stressors is most often related to a developing depression and/or suicidal ideation. Suicidal ideation is consistent with the picture of a depressed patient as described in this question, namely dejected... .poor eye contact... . A patient who is alcohol-intoxicated is 50 times more likely to commit suicide. The first step in the management of depression is always an assessment for suicidal ideation.",,
1215,2,OBGYN,"A 25 year old woman who is pregnant with her third child comes to the office for a regular prenatal visit. Medical history shows that she developed deep vein thrombosis of the left calf in the 22nd week of her last pregnancy 2 years ago. She is now 26 weeks pregnant, and she complains of left calf tenderness during the examination. Deep vein thrombosis is confirmed by Doppler ultrasonography. The most appropriate management is to:  ","Administer intravenous heparin initially, followed by warfarin until delivery",Do venous ligation proximal to the point of obstruction,Prescribe heparin until delivery,Prescribe warfarin until delivery,Prescribe heparin and indomethacin therapy until delivery,,3,"The occurrence of deep venous thrombosis during pregnancy is of concern because 5-20% of patients will experience pulmonary embolism, a potential fatal complication. In the early stages of thrombosis, the clot may be loosely adherent to the vessel wall, and amenable to pharmacologic intervention. The preferred agent is heparin. It is a potent inhibitor of thrombin, and thus prevents the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Because of its large molecular size and negative charge, it does not cross the placenta, and does not appear in breast milk. The dosage of heparin is monitored by measuring the partial prothrombin time, which should be two to three times the control value. Intravenous administration of protamine sulfate counteracts the effects of heparin quickly on a milligram-for-milligram basis.",,
1216,6,Surgery,"A 69 year old man with diabetes mellitus had a myocardial infarction 2 years ago. He has had exertional angina since then and has been taking propranolol. During the past few days he has had one episode of chest pain at rest, two episodes postprandially and one at night. Electrocardiogram reveals an old myocardial infarction. The most appropriate treatment is to  ",Admit him immediately for cardiac monitoring and adjustment of therapy,Admit him immediately for coronary artery bypass surgery,Decrease the dosage of propranolol and adding nitrates and salicylates,Increase the dosage of propranolol and having him return in 1 week,Advise resting from work and sedation at night and digitalization,,1,"The pattern of disease described in this diabetic man is consistent with unstable angina. Even though the electrocardiogram is unchanged presently, there is a high risk of progression of these symptoms to possible myocardial infarction. Therefore, the patient should be admitted to the hospital, monitored, and have his therapy adjusted. Many of these patients will require cardiac catheterization if their symptoms cannot be controlled with maximal medical therapy. At present, the patient is on submaximal therapy since he is only on propranolol, and may still benefit from the use of calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and aspirin. Furthermore, there is no indication from the question as to whether he is on maximal beta-blocker therapy, since his heart rate is not given. Doses of beta-blockers should be titrated to a resting heart rate of 55-60 bpm.",,
1217,3,PMCH,"You care for a family that consists of a husband, a wife, a daughter and a son. Each family member is healthy. The 71 year old maternal grandmother lived with the family until 4 weeks ago when she died suddenly after a prolonged respiratory illness. Autopsy revealed that she had active pulmonary tuberculosis at the time of her death. The organism tested sensitive to all commonly used anti-tuberculosis drugs. In following up on the grandmother's illness, the most appropriate first step in managing this family is to  ",Obtain leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate on all family members,Obtain sputum or gastric washings of all family members for culture for acid-fast bacilli,Place PPD skin tests on all family members,Place TB tine tests on the two children and PPD skin tests on the adults,Schedule bronchoscopy and alveolar lavage on the adults,,3,"The entire family has been exposed to the grandmother, who has had active tuberculosis. As close contacts, they are at risk for transmission of TB. The appropriate screening test at this time would be PPD testing. The family members should be considered at intermediate risk for TB, and therefore, a 5 mm area of induration would be considered a positive test.A PPD Test is considered positive when the induration is:- &gt;15 mm (Patients with no known risk factors)- &gt;10 mm (Patients with risk factors for TB including: Immigrant from endemic areas, prisoners, home care residents, injection drug users; persons with the following clinical conditions that place them at high risk: silicosis, DM, chronic renal failure etc; children under 4 years of age or infants, children and adolescents exposed to adults at high-risk)- &gt;5mm (for immunocompromised patients such as HIV patients, children taking chemotherapy, chronic corticosteroid treatment, recent contacts of TB case patients, persons with fibrotic changes on chest radiograph consistent with prior TB, patients with organ transplants)  ",,
1218,4,Pediatrics,"You see an obese female child in your office. In reviewing the management options for this patient, the most appropriate step is to:",Give her a written diet to follow,Recommend a behavior-oriented treatment program,Refer her to a commercial weight-loss center for diet management,Refer her to an endocrinologist for hormonal assessment,Tell her not to worry because she will grow into her weight,,2,"The most successful interventions in children who are obese are those that are family-based and behavior-oriented. This includes a diet program, physical activity, behavior modification techniques, and parental role modeling. A written diet and a commercial weight loss center do not the complete issue. An endocrinologist referral is not indicated at this time because this patient is most likely obese from overeating. Telling her not to worry and that she will grow into her weight is inappropriate as this girl is at increased risk for medical disorders, such as slipped capital femoral epiphysis, and therefore she should be encouraged to lose weight.",,
1219,6,Surgery,A 27 year old man comes to the office because of a 1 week history of right knee pain. He says he jogs 3 miles a day and that the pain in his knee worsens during his run. On physical examination his gait appears to be normal. Examination of the right knee reveals tenderness and fullness over the medial collateral ligament. On physical examination there is most likely to be,Increased anterior laxity with anterior pressure on the tibia,Increased posterior laxity with posterior pressure on the tibia,Pain on compression of the patella against the femur,Pain during forceful abduction of the knee,A painful clicking sensation with inward rotation of the foot and extension of the knee,qe438.gif,4,"This is a classic description of injured medial collateral ligaments, which results from constant stress in valgus position. Integrity of the medial collateral ligament is tested by performing forceful abduction of the knee while placing one hand on the lateral aspect of the knee, which is flexed about 20 degrees, and pushing the leg outward with the right hand. Abduction with the opening of the joint line more than 5 mm and associated pain usually indicates rupture of the medial collateral ligament.",,
1220,1,Medicine,"A 38 year old man returns to the office for follow-up of an abnormal liver chemistry profile ordered 3 weeks ago during a routine examination. At that time, his physical examination was normal, but he had a serum AST concentration of 72 U/L. His serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase concentrations were normal. History includes an episode of hepatitis A at age 22 years. He has no history of transfusions or intravenous drug use. He drinks two to three beers daily. Today's follow-up test results show: Anti-HAV PositiveAnti-HBs NegativeHBsAg PositiveHBcAg PositiveWhich of the following is the most appropriate next step?  ",Begin interferon-alfa therapy,Begin corticosteroid therapy,Have him cease all alcohol consumption and retest him in 2 months,Order hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase study,Schedule liver biopsy,,3,"The indication for extensive testing in this patient was the abnormal liver enzymes. The results of this testing reveals a positive HAV antibody which is indicative of prior exposure to the hepatitis A virus. Hepatitis B virus, a DNA virus, is transmitted through parenteral or mucosal exposure to infectious blood or body fluids and can lead to chronic as well as acute infection, cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Only approximately 10% of all acute hepatitis B infections progress to chronic infection in adults. The presence of a positive HBsAg (surface antigen to hepatitis B) and HBcAg (core antigen) indicates acute, active hepatitis B infection. After infection and 1 to 6 weeks before symptoms occur HBsAg appears. The relevant question concerns the actual effect on liver enzymes. For this reasons, the patient should refrain from alcohol consumption, which also elevates liver enzymes.",,
1221,4,Pediatrics,"A 6 month old infant is brought to the office by his parents because of intermittent swelling in his right scrotum. They say the swelling is more pronounced when he cries. The swelling has never been red or stuck. A right inguinal hernia is confirmed on physical examination. In discussing repair of the hernia with the parents, you should inform them that: ",Herniorrhaphy can be postponed until age 2 years because many hernias close spontaneously,Herniorrhaphy can be postponed until age 12 years because oligospermia does not develop before age 12,Herniorrhaphy should be scheduled at the earliest convenient time,Herniorrhaphy should be scheduled as an emergency,There is no need to repair a hernia in childhood unless incarceration occurs,,3,"Like cryptorchidism, a patent processus vaginalis very often allows peritoneal fluid (hydrocele) and other peritoneal contents (mainly intestines) to come in contact with the testicle. This exposes the descended testis in the scrotum to more or less similar risk factors for malignant degeneration as an undescended one. These hernias do not close spontaneously, probably due to the constant crying, which maintains a high intraabdominal pressure. The main purpose of the herniorrhaphy is to prevent incarceration and malignant degeneration.",,
1222,1,Medicine,"A 35 year old man who is a new city employee was driving a city-owned car when he was struck from behind by another car. He experienced immediate neck and shoulder pain and was seen and examined by you in the emergency department. Physical examination showed slight cervical muscle spasm. Cervical spine and shoulder x-ray films at that time were normal. You reassured him that no structural damage was evident on the studies. He was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and was scheduled for a return visit in the office in 2 weeks. Today, at the 4-week return visit, he insists his condition has not improved and demands everything be done to find out why I still hurt. Physical examination including neurologic examination, is normal. Repeat x-ray films of the cervical spine are normal. At this time it is most appropriate to:  ",Inform the patient that no additional studies are needed,Order a CT scan of the cervical spine,Order an MRI of the cervical spine,Order studies the patient requests,Refer him to a neurologist,,1,"Despite the patient requests, there is nothing at this time to suggest any additional work-up. It is important to communicate clearly to the patient that you are not giving up, and that it is your assessment that no further testing is needed at this time. Assure him that you will continue to follow up this problem with him. The other choices, any further testing or consults would have a low yield result, and would cause great expense in a situation where there is low suspicion and a possibility of false positives.",,
1223,1,Medicine,"An 80 year old woman is brought to the office for the first time by her son because she has signs of mildly decreasing mental function. She is having increasing trouble reading, writing and watching television. She has mild, stable angina pectoris and she had an uncomplicated myocardial infarction 8 years ago. Physical examination now is normal except for corrected visual acuity of 20/200 O.U., which appears to be caused by cataracts. Mini-mental state test score is 29 out of 30. Which of the following is the most correct statement about this patient's condition?  ",Her daily activities would probably improve if she had cataract extraction with lens implantation,Her diminished mental status is a contraindication for a cataract operation,Her history of cardiac disease and advanced age are contraindications for a cataract operation,Her mental status should be reevaluated in 1 year,You need more information to decide whether she would be helped by a cataract operation,,1,"This question clearly describes the patient who has stable medical problems, which would not be a contraindication to cataract repair under local anesthesia. Her degree of visual impairment would certainly interfere with daily activities, and suggesting surgical correction clearly indicates that the physician is aware of the importance of the patient's quality of life. Her possibly diminished mental status or history of cardiac disease are not contraindications to the surgery. And there is no additional information needed to decide if she would benefit from the surgery. While re-evaluating her mental status in one year may be appropriate, it does nothing to improve her quality of life at the present time.",,

",Do a PPD skin test,Initiate an immunologic evaluation,Order sweat chloride test,Presume the murmur is functional and schedule follow-up visits,Seek consultation with a cardiologist,,5,"Seek consultation with a cardiologist, as this patient with grade 2-3/6 systolic ejection murmur (heard best at the left sternal border and over the entire precordium) associated with two episodes of pneumonia, has a cardiac abnormality. A PPD skin test is done in patients who are suspected of having tuberculosis. Initiating an immunologic evaluation should not be done in this patient because the patient is having recurrent pneumonia from heart disease, not because of immunocompromise. Likewise, a sweat chloride determination should not be done, because although the patient has had two pneumonias, these were most likely secondary to a heart defect, not cystic fibrosis.",,
1225,5,Psychiatry,"A 17 year old boy is brought to the office by his mother who says that he has been increasingly withdrawn and preoccupied for several weeks. He has been sleeping poorly and has refused to leave the house for the past week because he believes he is being followed. When his father insisted he attend school this morning, the patient threatened him with a knife. On examination, the patient is sweating, has dilated pupils and is obviously fearful.Rapport with this patient can best be established by asking which of the following?  ",&quot;Are you hearing voices?&quot;,&quot;Do you have a special mission to accomplish?&quot;,&quot;Do you think you are being persecuted?&quot;,&quot;How do you feel others are treating you?&quot;,&quot;Who do you think is following you?&quot;,,4,"Rapport is defined as an empathic and trusting working relationship between a psychiatrist and patient. Rapport is usually best established by addressing the feelings of the patient. Most patients respond best to a doctor who first attempts to understand a person's emotional state and clarifies symptoms afterwards. Asking about symptoms may give you information, but it does not establish rapport. Similarly, asking about specific thoughts the patient is having will give you information, but will not establish a collaborative relationship.",,
1226,4,Pediatrics,"A 5 year old boy is brought to the office by his mother because of recurrence of bed-wetting at night. He has a 3 month old sister who is healthy. Physical examination is normal.

",This condition will cease if they reprimand him for deliberately wetting the bed,"The condition is self-limiting, and they should take care to lessen the emotional impact on their child",This is a potentially serious problem and could represent chronic inflammation of the kidneys,This may be a precursor of diabetes mellitus,This signifies a serious underlying emotional disorder,,2,"In the absence of an organic etiology, emotional stress (possibly arising from the arrival of a new sibling) is the most likely etiology of this child's secondary enuresis. Complete urinalysis is essential in eliminating disorders such as urinary tract infections, diabetes mellitus, and diabetes insipidus. Most episodes of nocturnal enuresis are self-limited, and may not require additional therapy. The timing of the boy's bed-wetting is significant. He has just suffered a major disruption to his world, the birth of a sibling, and may be regressing in reaction to this event. Certainly this behavior is likely to refocus his parent's attention on him, which may be what he is seeking at an unconscious level. At any rate, the most logical advice from the physician should be reassurance that the bed-wetting will go away, especially if the parents reassure the boy of their continuing love for him.  ",,

",She should be reported to child abuse authorities,She was clearly a victim of child abuse herself,She would benefit from antidepressant medication,She would benefit from family counseling,She would exhibit better self-control if she were married,,4,"There is insufficient evidence from the information given that the mother is abusing her child. The patient describes feeling overwhelmed; engaging the mother and the two children in family therapy may be of great value in assisting her with coping mechanisms. There is insufficient evidence from the question to indicate that she was clearly a victim of child abuse herself or that she would benefit from antidepressant medication, although this may be a consideration upon further determination of the patient's mood and ability to adjust to her social environment.",,

He has had constitutional symptoms of fever, malaise, weight loss, and night sweats for the last four to six weeks. This interval of time indicates that this is not an acute illness, such as would be caused by diverticulitis or pyelonephritis . There is no risk factor described for the patient to have developed malaria. Although patients with Hodgkin disease may present with these constitutional symptoms over four to six weeks, there is no description in the physical examination of adenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly.

Examination reveals the following: temp 38.5C, no uterine contractions, vague lower abdominal tenderness, fetal heart rate 185 bpm. Lab investigations reveal: Hb 120, WBC 19.0, + nitrazine test of vaginal fluid, + ferning of vaginal fluid. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ",Premature rupture of membranes,Premature rupture of membranes and chorioamnionitis,Premature labour,Acute pyelonephritis,Acute vaginitis of pregnancy,,2,"Rupture of the membranes before onset of labor is considered premature; it sometimes results in infection. Diagnosis is clinical. If fetal lungs are immature and infection is absent, treatment is bed rest plus delay of delivery with Mg sulfate and other tocolytic drugs as needed. If fetal lungs are mature or if fetal compromise or infection is present, treatment is expedited delivery (eg, by inducing labor). Chorioamnionitis is infection of the chorion and amnion, usually occurring near term. Chorioamnionitis may result from an infection that ascends through the genital tract. Risk factors include premature rupture of membranes and prolonged labor. Consequences of chorioamnionitis include premature rupture of membranes and premature labor, and increased risk of neonatal pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, and death.Diagnosis is suggested by fever occurring late in pregnancy. Fetal heart rate monitoring is required. Fetal heart rate increases during fever but, in the absence of chorioamnionitis, returns to baseline as fever resolves. Fetal tachycardia out of proportion to or in the absence of fever suggests chorioamnionitis.",,
1232,2,OBGYN,A 24 year old female presents with abdominal pain. Beta-HCG is negative. Pelvic ultrasound shows a 5 cm right ovarian cyst. You would: ,Perform immediate laporotomy,Perform immediate laproscopy,Aspirate the cyst under ultrasonographic guidance,Order a CBC and a CA125,Expectant management with repeat ultrasound in 8 weeks,,5,"The management of ovarian cysts depends on a number of factors, including age of the woman, size of the cyst, type of cyst as determined by ultrasound (simple or complex), level of CA-125 and the presence or not of symptoms. If ultrasound identifies that the cyst is simple, a wait-and-see plan ('expectant management') may be appropriate, because many simple ovarian cysts resolve spontaneously. In fact one study of 278 women aged 14 to 81 years with simple cysts found that 44% of cysts resolved with no treatment. With expectant management, the woman has a repeat ultrasound 6-8 weeks after the simple cyst was first diagnosed. In the past, combined oral contraceptives were often prescribed to pre-menopausal patients during this time, but it is now accepted that these agents only prevent the development of functional cysts and do not suppress them. If the cyst has persisted after the observation period, then the patient is usually referred for surgical evaluation.",,

Risk factors include a large fetus and maternal obesity or diabetes mellitus. Shoulder dystocia is identified if the head, after passing through the cervix, appears to be pulled back tightly against the vulva (turtle sign). Asphyxiation can occur because the vaginal canal compresses the chest so that the fetus cannot breathe. Hypoxic injury can begin within 4 to 5 minutes.",,
1236,2,OBGYN,Fetal exposure to lithium in the first trimester has been strongly associated with: ,Alopecia,Cleft lip and palate,Congenital heart defects,Limb defects,Mental retardation,,3,"Ebstein's anomaly, also called Ebstein's malformation, is a heart defect in which the tricuspid valve is abnormally formed. The tricuspid valve normally has three &quot;flaps&quot; or leaflets. In Ebstein's anomaly, one or two of the three leaflets are stuck to the wall of the heart and don't move normally. Often there's also a hole in the wall between the atria, the heart's two upper chambers. This hole is called an atrial septal defect or ASD. Because the tricuspid valve is malformed in Ebstein's anomaly, it often doesn't work properly and may leak. If the valve leaks, some of the blood pumped by the right ventricle goes backwards through the valve with each heartbeat. Studies suggest that lithium might be involved as a teratogen increasing the incidence of Ebstein's anomaly in the offspring of female patients with manic-depressive psychosis and lithium-administered during pregnancy.",,

Fibroids frequently cause abnormal vaginal bleeding (eg, menorrhagia, menometrorrhagia), pelvic pain and pressure, urinary and intestinal symptoms, and pregnancy complications. Diagnosis is by pelvic examination and imaging. Fibroids can cause hypermenorrhea, menorrhagia or menometrorrhagia. If fibroids grow, degenerate, or hemorrhage, or if pedunculated fibroids twist, severe acute or chronic pressure or pain can result. Urinary symptoms (eg, urinary frequency or urgency) can result from bladder compression, and intestinal symptoms (eg, constipation) can result from intestinal compression.",,
1238,1,Medicine,Which of the following statements about estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women is correct? ,It is a major risk factor for breast cancer,It decreases hepatic triglyceride production,It produces hypertension,It protects against vertebral compression fractures,It directly stimulates the proliferation of vascular endothelium,,4,"Postmenopausal osteoporosis results from increased osteoclast activity and affects primarily trabecular bone. It occurs between ages 51 and 75 and is 6 times more common in women than in men. Estrogen loss may elevate levels of cytokines, which are thought to increase recruitment and activity of osteoclasts in trabecular bone, resulting in increased bone resorption. Late menarche, early menopause, and nulliparity increase the risk. Although calcitonin levels are decreased in women compared with men, calcitonin deficiency does not appear to be important. Estrogen can preserve bone density and prevent fractures. Most effective if started within 4 to 6 years of menopause, estrogen may slow bone loss and possibly reduce fractures even when started much later.",,

It peaks by the end of the second trimester, after which it reaches a plateau until delivery. The change in cardiac output is mediated by 1) increased preload due to the rise in blood volume, 2) reduced afterload due to a fall in systemic vascular resistance, 3) a rise in the maternal heart rate by 10 to 15 beats per minute. Stroke volume increases during the first and second trimesters, but declines in the third trimester due to caval compression by the gravid uterus. The direct effect of pregnancy on cardiac contractility is controversial.Blood pressure typically falls, usually reaching a nadir of 10 mm Hg below baseline by the end of the second trimester. The decline in blood pressure is mediated by a fall in systemic vascular resistance induced by hormonal changes and by the addition of a low-resistance circuit through the uteroplacental bed.",,

Which of the following statements regarding infertility is correct? ,10% of couples are infertile,Only 40% of couples achieve pregnancy within 6 months of trying,Only 20% achieve pregnancy within 1 year of trying,Male factors are responsible for over half of infertility causes,Infertility is inability to achieve a pregnancy after trying for 1 year.,,5,"Infertility is the inability of a couple to achieve a pregnancy after repeated intercourse without contraception for 1 year.Infertility affects about 1 of 5 couples in the Canada. It is becoming increasingly common because people are waiting longer to marry and to have a child. Nevertheless, up to 60% of the couples who have not conceived after a year of trying do conceive eventually, with or without treatment. The goal of treatment is to reduce the time needed to conceive or to provide couples who might not otherwise conceive the opportunity to do so. Before treatment is begun, counseling that provides information about the treatment process (including its duration) and the chances of success is beneficial.The cause of infertility may be due to problems in the man, the woman, or both. Problems with sperm, ovulation, or the fallopian tubes each account for almost one third of infertility cases. In a small percentage of cases, infertility is caused by problems with mucus in the cervix or by unidentified factors. Thus, the diagnosis of infertility problems requires a thorough assessment of both partners.",,
1243,2,OBGYN,Vaginal discharge which is fishy in odor and associated with 20% clue cells on microscopy will not be associated with which of the following: ,Be due to gardnerella vaginalis overgrowth,Can be treated with metronidazole or clindamycin,With the addition of KOH may see hyphae or spores,"Must be treated in all pregnant women, including asymptomatic",Is rarely associated with inflamed or itchy vulva,,3,"When a woman reports an unusual vaginal discharge, the doctor will ask her a series of routine questions to help distinguish mild from more serious conditions. Additional issues that might indicate the presence of a more serious condition include fever, pelvic pain, new or multiple sexual partners (especially with unprotected intercourse), and a history of sexually-transmitted infections.Examining the vaginal discharge under the microscope can help distinguish bacterial vaginosis from yeast vaginitis (candidiasis) and trichomonas (a type of sexually transmitted infection). A sign of bacterial vaginosis under the microscope is an unusual vaginal cell called a clue cell. Clue cells are believed to be the most reliable diagnostic sign of bacterial vaginosis. In addition to clue cells, women with bacterial vaginosis have fewer of the normal vaginal bacteria, called lactobacilli. A vaginal pH greater than 4.5 is also suggestive of bacterial vaginosis.Hyphae or spores are seen in fungal infections such as candida vaginitis.",,
1244,1,Medicine,A 35 year old man has been on life support systems for the past 48 hours following blunt head trauma. Which of the following is the most important criterion to declare the patient brain dead and to permit removal of life support systems?  ,Bedside EEG showing no electrical activity,Decorticate and decerebrate posturing,Failure to respond to electroconvulsive stimuli,Glasgow coma score of 3 or less,Unenhanced MRI of the brain showing dilated ventricles,,1,"The definition of brain death is constantly being revised. However, if there is no electrical activity on EEG, and if there is total loss of all brain stem reflexes, then it is safe to label an already irreversibly comatose patient as brain dead. The most definitive measure of absent brain activity is an EEG. However, remember that before interpreting a flat-line EEG, one must ascertain that the patient is not hypothermic or suffering from barbiturate overdose, since these can give the appearance of no electrical activity on an EEG.",,
1245,1,Medicine,A 30 year old man has been on life support systems for the past 48 hours following blunt head trauma. Brain death cannot be established in this patient if there is the presence of which of the following?  ,Carotid blood flow,Cremasteric reflexes,Elevated serum aminoglycoside concentrations,Hypothermia,Marked cerebral edema,,4,"Hypothermia should be excluded before making a diagnosis of brain death. If present, it can be the cause of a flat EEG. Carotid blood flow implies the presence of cerebral circulation, and hence the presence of some viable tissue. The absence of carotid blood flow does not help diagnosis either due to the presence of the vertebral system. Cremasteric reflexes are spinal reflexes (and not brainstem reflexes), and their presence does not exclude the diagnosis. Elevated serum aminoglycoside concentration is nonspecific, and has little bearing. Cerebral edema does not rule out brain death.",,

I can't bear this.&quot; Which of the following is the most appropriate initial intervention?  ",Adjust his analgesic regimen,Arrange for him to be transferred to a psychiatric service,Begin antidepressant medication,Initiate hyperalimentation,Refer him to a cancer patient support group,,1,"The patient is medically unstable, should remain on a medical service, and should not be transferred to a psychiatric service. Pain is the number-one cause of suicide in the terminally ill, and decreasing the pain by maximizing analgesia will help the patient face dying with dignity. Providing adequate pain relief when you are dealing with a terminally ill patient is crucial to maintaining the highest possible quality of life. If this man's pain is this severe, then adjusting the analgesic regimen is the only logical step. There is no evidence of a clinical syndrome of major depression so an antidepressant is not indicated. Hyperalimentation may be needed if the patient is not eating, or is unable to eat. This is most likely due to chemotherapy, or pain or cachexia secondary to cancer. Decreasing the pain can result in increased appetite. A cancer patient support group will be useful in the long run, but will not help the patient until the acute crisis is resolved, namely the wish to die.",,

",Anorexia,Expressions of discouragement,Insomnia,Low energy,Withdrawal from family,,5,"There is no question that anorexia, expressions of discouragement, insomnia, and low energy are symptoms of depression. Expressions of discouragement are less intense than the hopelessness seen in major depression. However, as patients become more depressed, they cling even tighter to the family for support, and become more dependent on them, making withdrawal from the family more significant. In addition, anorexia, insomnia, and low energy may be secondary to the malignant melanoma. As the support of family members is the mainstay of most terminally ill patients, withdrawal from this support would be strong evidence of depression, or possibly even of suicidal intent. All of the rest are either appropriate behaviors or could be the side effects of the disease or treatment, such as low energy, insomnia, or anorexia.",,

The patient is seen in the maternity ward 24 hours after vaginal delivery and repair of a fourth degree perineal laceration. She is currently able to walk to the bathroom and void without difficulty, but she has not had a bowel movement since delivery. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable and her only medications are prenatal vitamins. Vital signs are temperature 37.2&deg;C (99.0&deg;F), pulse 68/min, respirations 18/min, and blood pressure 128/86 mm Hg. The uterus is palpable to the level of the umbilicus. The vaginal laceration is not inflamed or swollen. Sutures are intact and there is no drainage from the site. Lochia is normal. Hemoglobin concentration is 108 g/L.The patient tells you that she is concerned about her insurance company requirement that she stay in the hospital no longer than 48 hours post partum. Which of the following would be the most important indication for extending her hospital stay beyond 48 hours post partum?  ",Abdominal distention and lack of appetite at 48 hours post partum,Lack of bowel movement post partum,Need for nursing assistance with breast-feeding,Palpation of the uterus above the pubic symphysis for more than 48 hours post partum,Persistence of lochia for more than 24 hours post partum,,1,"A common postpartum complication is infection. The presentation of a puerperal infection may be atypical because of the altered physiology of the postpartum period. Abdominal distention (ileus) and lack of appetite may be the first manifestation of abdominopelvic peritonitis. Careful evaluation of the patient is required with respect to the genitourinary tract. Risks for the development of postpartum infection include vaginal trauma (which this patient had), anemia (this patient's hemoglobin is 108), multiple pelvic examinations, internal fetal monitoring, prolonged rupture of the membranes, and indigent status. Continued surveillance is indicated so that the reason for distention and lack of appetite can be identified and treated.&gt;The duration of the patient's labor is not given, but it is likely that she has not eaten solid food in some time. Some narcotic medications used for analgesia during labor may contribute to decreased intestinal motility. She should be reassured that normal bowel function can be anticipated. Therefore, a lack of bowel movement in the immediate puerperium is not unusual, and is not a reason to extend her stay. &gt;Assistance in establishing a satisfactory breastfeeding regimen is available from alternative sources. Continued hospitalization to obtain this support is not necessary.&gt;A normal uterus can be expected to be palpated abdominally for about two weeks postpartum. It normally regains its nonpregnant size about four weeks after  delivery. Therefore, the uterus would be expected to be palpated above thesymphysis 48 hours after delivery. An extended hospital stay on this basis is not justi&#64257;ed. &gt;Lochia, the uterine discharge, is expected for about &#64257;ve weeks postpartum. Therefore, the presence of lochia for more than 24 hours is normal and is not a reason to extend the patient's hospital stay",,

She should be advised of which of the following?  ,"Although she will have symptoms of hypothyroidism, she will not be given the medication","Although she will not receive the medication, she will have no adverse effects",The medication will be administered daily while the nasogastric tube is clamped,The medication will be discontinued temporarily before the operation,She will receive the medication intravenously,,2,"Thyroxine is the hormone of choice for replacement therapy. It has a half-life of seven days, and any alteration in dose is not reflected for four to six weeks. Therefore, it is very unlikely that she will develop signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism. She will not be given the medication either through the nasogastric tube or intravenously, nor does she require a preoperative loading dose.",,

On physical examination, she is dazed, has no memory of her fall and is unable to respond to any questions about her health. X-ray films of the pelvis taken upon arrival at the hospital show a fracture of the left femoral neck. She is known to have taken butabarbital daily for many years. Uneventful surgical repair of the femur fracture is done the morning after admission. On the evening after the operation, the patient becomes combative, begins to hallucinate and has a brief, generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Which of the following is the most likely cause for the change in her behavior?  ",Barbiturate withdrawal,Cerebral concussion,Inadequate treatment of an underlying epileptic disorder,Potentiation of morphine by phenytoin,Warfarin side effect,,1,"The only clue in this history as to the etiology of the patient's current issues is the daily consumption of barbiturate for a number of years. This daily intake will have resulted in a certain physical and psychological tolerance that, once the medication is stopped, would result in &ldquo;withdrawal&rdquo; symptoms and signs. In addition, the history is quite clear that during a prior attempt to lower the dosage, the patient reportedly suffered from seizures at that time. Therefore, the most likely etiology of the seizures in this case is barbiturate withdrawal.",,
1252,6,Surgery,A 50 year old woman is in the recovery room following an uneventful cholecystectomy. Two hours after the procedure she begins to have ventricular extra-systoles and her systolic blood pressure falls from 110 mm Hg to 90 mm Hg. Arterial blood gas values while breathing room air are: PO2 58 mm HgPCO2 52 mm HgpH 7.30These signs are most likely the result of which of the following?  ,Alveolar hypoventilation,Occult hemorrhage,Primary cardiac irritability and failure,Primary hypoxemia resulting from anesthetic gases,Pulmonary embolus,,1,"Hypoxemia (low PO2) and hypercapnia (high PCO2) developing shortly after major surgery are classical for postoperative acute respiratory failure. None of the answers use that diagnosis, but answers a) and d) describe the two components of this complication. Answer d) however, is not correct because the problem is not due to the direct pharmacological effect of the anesthetic (not two hours after the end of the operation). Neither hemorrhage nor cardiac irritability would affect the blood gases in this way, and pulmonary embolus is seen several days after surgery and bed rest, not within a couple of hours of surgery.",,

She is confined to bed awaiting further diagnostic studies for preeclampsia. Her blood pressure is now 160/100 mm Hg. She is complaining of headaches, blurred vision and epigastric pain. At this time it is most appropriate to conclude that this patient has which of the following?  ",Chronic hypertension and requires antihypertensive therapy,"Chronic hypertension, but no antihypertensive therapy is necessary",Mild preeclampsia and should continue bed rest pending further diagnostic studies,Severe preeclampsia and requires immediate medical management and delivery,Severe preeclampsia and should continue bed rest pending further diagnostic studies,,4,"This patient has severe preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is diagnosed on the basis of her elevated blood pressure and proteinuria occurring after 20 weeks' gestation. She has severe preeclampsia on the basis of her headaches, blurred vision, and epigastric pain. This patient requires magnesium sulfate to prevent eclampsia (seizures occurring in the setting of preeclampsia). Magnesium sulfate has been shown to be the most effective agent to use for the prevention of seizures in women with preeclampsia. She also requires delivery to arrest the disease process. Delivery is the only &ldquo;cure&rdquo; for preeclampsia. Bed rest pending further diagnostic studies is inappropriate because delivery is necessary to prevent a worsening of the disease process that can be fatal for mother and fetus.",,

Her current medications include oxycodone, amitriptyline, perphenazine, fluoxetine and trazodone. On physical examination, the patient is 10% below her ideal body weight, pupils are constricted and skin turgor is poor. She seems sluggish and her speech is slow. Results of neurologic examination and x-ray films of the lumbosacral spine are normal. If a medication is responsible for her mental condition, the medication is most likely to be which of the following?  ",Amitriptyline,Fluoxetine,Oxycodone,Perphenazine,Trazodone,,3,"The question gives you the classic sign of opiate use: constricted pupils. Prolonged use of opiates may also induce depression. Amitriptyline can cause weight gain, and does not cause pupil constriction. Fluoxetine may result in mild weight loss of two to five pounds, but does not cause pupil constriction. Neither perphenazine nor trazodone cause pupillary constriction.",,

Six hours later, his mental status is improved, blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg and serum glucose concentration is 250 mg/dL. Physical examination at that time shows a cold left foot with diminished pulses compared with those of the right foot. The most likely explanation for the diminished pulses is:  ",Paradoxical embolus from the femoral vein,Diabetic arteriopathy,Inadvertent injury of the femoral artery,Intense arteriolar constriction induced by hyperosmolality,Thrombosis of the catheterized femoral vein,,3,"During percutaneous placement of central venous lines, many complications are possible. Depending on the site of placement, the most serious complications vary. For all line placements however, injury to the accompanying artery poses a serious risk. In this case, the presence of a cold foot without pulses on the side ipsilateral to the line placement strongly suggests damage to the femoral artery.",,

Her disease is limited to the descending colon. Current therapy includes sulfasalazine and corticosteroid enemas. While she is receiving parenteral corticosteroid therapy, she is discovered to be 8 weeks pregnant. The statement that should be emphasized in discussing this pregnancy with her is: ",Abortion should be considered since ulcerative colitis increases the incidence of premature births and congenital anomalies,Abortion should be considered because of the adverse effect of pregnancy on ulcerative colitis,Abortion should be considered because of the teratogenic effects of her colitis therapy,Occurrence of spontaneous abortions does not correlate with disease activity,Sulfasalazine and corticosteroids are not known to be teratogenic,,5,"Sulfasalazine and corticosteroids are not known to be teratogenic. The general consensus is that ulcerative colitis does not have an adverse effect on pregnancy outcome, and that pregnancy does not have an adverse effect on disease progression. Furthermore, use of the medications sulfasalazine and prednisone has not been associated with detrimental effects to the mother or the fetus. Some believe that occurrence of spontaneous abortions correlate with disease activity, therefore is incorrect.",,

However, it is clear from the description of this scenario that the daughter is trying to coerce her mother into a decision with which she does not necessarily agree. It would therefore be appropriate to speak to the patient privately in order to better ascertain the mother's true feelings regarding this situation. Note that even though the daughter is acting in what she assumes is the mother's best interest, the concept of patient autonomy dictates that the mother is allowed to make her own independent decision.",,

A very effective measure to prevent falls is to have an experienced visiting nurse assess the various hazards that may exist in the patient's home. Typical measures that are then taken include installing guardrails around the bathtub and toilet, ensuring adequate lighting, making sure that all stairways in the home are well-lit, and that the stairs are demarcated from the adjoining floor, and eliminating loose rugs, wires, or other objects that may predispose to tripping and falling. While advising her to walk only when accompanied by an adult, ensuring that she does not have orthostatic hypotension providing her with assistance with activities of daily living and an electric wheelchair may reduce the number of falls, it is best to have her environment evaluated to reduce the hazards that she is facing in daily life.",,

A submaximal exercise test can even be done before the patient is discharged from the hospital. An electrocardiogram and a 24 hour ambulatory EKG would demonstrate any predispositions to arrhythmia, but would not yield any information regarding risk of ischemia.

Two days later, at 1:30 AM, the patient has suddenly slumped over and the nurse is unable to obtain a pulse or blood pressure reading. The patient has agonal respirations and then stops breathing. The first physician to arrive at the patient's bedside should  ",Call the attending physician,Call the patient's husband,Pronounce the patient dead,Initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation,Initiate intravenous chemical resuscitation,,3,"The patient has likely died. Her agonal respirations and cessation of respiratory effort suggest this. Given that the patient has clear do not resuscitate orders, the first priority is to establish that death has occurred. Pronouncement of death requires a physician. Calling the attending physician or the patient's husband should not occur until it is certain that the patient has in fact died. The reasons for this are obvious. Once the patient has been pronounced dead however, these are appropriate phone calls to make.

She asks you what the chances are of her baby being infected with HIV. It is most appropriate to tell her which of the following?  ","Since she has no symptoms of AIDS, there is a strong likelihood that her baby will not be infected",Having untreated syphilis at delivery increases her baby's risk for being infected by 50%,Her baby has at least a 50% chance of not being infected and will need to be followed closely since it is difficult to make the diagnosis at birth,"If the results of ELISA and Western blot testing of the baby are positive, the baby is definitely infected","Because she acquired her infection through a heterosexual transmission, there is only a 20% risk that her baby is infected",,3,"The risk of vertical transmission of HIV (from mother to child) has been revived a number of times since the initial clinical description of HIV and AIDS in the 1980s. As it currently stands, the consensus opinion on risk is approximately 50% in women with children that have not received perinatal therapy with AZT. The medication protocol reduces the risk to less than 25%. Because newborn children have antibody complements that are from their mothers, it is crucial to follow them over the first year of life as their own immune system develops. Symptoms of AIDS are not related to risk of transmission of HIV. AIDS is defined as a CD4 count of less than 200 with an HIV-associated disease present (such as PCP pneumonia or Kaposi sarcoma). The risk of infection instead relates to the viral burden in the bloodstream of the mother. This burden is quantified using HIV RNA copy number. The HIV RNA copy number relates to symptomatic AIDS in a complex manner but low copy number patients can be symptomatic and vice versa.",,

",An error in diagnostic accuracy,Legal negligence,Malpractice,A therapeutic misadventure,Violation of the principle of nonmaleficence,,1,"Scenarios such as this are quite common in clinical medicine. Diagnostic errors and their study is a large field that occupies many people. The causes why physicians make diagnostic errors are legion, but many relate to heuristic triggers and failure to interpret new data in light of changing diagnostic hypotheses. This patient had many signs and symptoms suggestive of pneumonia. Some of these findings, such as the localized pleuritic chest pain, are not 100% specific. A more detailed history of the duration of symptoms and their rapidity of onset (rapid favors diagnosis of an embolism) would have been helpful. Legal negligence like malpractice is a legal terms that reflects errors which occur outside the standard of accepted medical practice. Duty, breach, causation, damages are elements of a negligence action and such a determination can be made only by a judge. Malpractice specifically relates to care not within the accepted practice guidelines. There is no evidence from this vignette that the patient was misdiagnosed based upon practice outside this standard.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause for his worsening symptoms?  ",Acute bacterial endocarditis,Acute myocardial infarction,Dissection of the aorta,Esophageal reflux with spasm,Perforated peptic ulcer,,3,"The factor that immediately points to dissection of the aorta is that the patient has Marfan syndrome. Cardiovascular problems are the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in such patients. Mitral valve prolapse often develops early, and are seen in more than 80% of adult Marfan syndrome patients. However, of most concern is disease of the ascending aorta, of which dilation of the aortic root is most serious, since a possibly fatal subsequent dissection and rupture can occur. One must always think acute aortic dissection for a Marfan patient with sudden onset of severe chest pain. The tearing quality of the pain also tends to point toward aortic dissection. The pain results from stimulation of nerve endings in the adventitia, and it begins abruptly, rapidly becoming severe.",,

The diagnosis is confirmed by cultures of the cervix for Chlamydia trachomatis (more common) and Neisseria gonorrhea (less common). Culdocentesis, transvaginal sampling of the cul-de-sac, can be performed to confirm the diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy; the presence of nonclotting blood is highly suggestive. Laparoscopy can be performed if there is suspicion of Tubo-ovarian abscess; in this case, however, no masses are palpated. Since the patient has recently had a menstrual period, measurement of serum hCG will not provide additional information. Ultrasonography is also employed to better characterize a physical finding such as a pelvic mass.",,
1268,5,Psychiatry,"A 26 year old man is brought to the emergency department by his family because he says that he is being followed by gangsters and that they are going to kill him. Temperature is 37.8C (100.0F), pulse is 110/min and blood pressure is 160/95 mm Hg. His pupils are dilated. The remainder of the physical examination is normal. The family states that he has a history of drug abuse. Which of the following drugs most likely caused this reaction?  ",Alcohol,Cocaine,Diazepam,Heroin,,,2,"This patient shows symptoms of paranoia and sympathetic stimulation. Common symptoms of cocaine use include the classic ones associated with sympathetic stimulation, such as tachycardia, hypertension, mydriasis, and sweating. Paranoia, suspiciousness, and psychosis may occur with prolonged use.Although at low levels alcohol induces some behavioral stimulation, it is a CNS depressant. Occasionally chronic alcohol use induces paranoia, but dementia and memory loss are more common symptoms. Diazepam, sold under the trade name Valium, is commonly prescribed as an antianxiety drug or muscle relaxant, and does not produce the symptoms noted. Heroin, like most opioids, is also a CNS depressant, and symptoms associated with its use include drowsiness, slurred speech, memory impairment, occasional perceptual disturbances, and pinpoint pupils.",,
1269,6,Surgery,"A 35 year old woman is seen in the emergency department because of the sudden onset of severe low back pain 12 hours earlier. The pain began when she bent over to pick up her 2 year old child. Low doses of ibuprofen have eased the discomfort slightly. Careful physical examination, including a neurologic examination, is normal except for evidence of muscle spasm. She believes she has a herniated disc because 2 years ago her father developed the sudden onset of back pain that required immediate surgery. Which of the following is the most appropriate first step?  ",Order CT scan of the lumbar spine,Order MRI of the lumbar spine,Order x-ray films of the lumbar spine,Reassure her and treat with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID),Request consultation with an orthopedic surgeon,,4,"This patient has an acute back syndrome that is most likely due to lumbosacral muscle sprain or strain. The normal neurologic examination does not suggest any evidence of a radiculopathy, and therefore a disc herniation is less likely. The great majority of these injuries improve with NSAID use and bedrest for approximately three days. Longer periods of bedrest, immobilization, or traction have not been demonstrated to improve outcomes when compared to three days of bedrest.",,
1270,6,Surgery,"A 35 year old woman is seen in the emergency department because of the sudden onset of severe low back pain 12 hours earlier. Careful physical examination, including a neurologic examination, is normal except for evidence of muscle spasm. She believes she has a herniated disc because 2 years ago her father developed the sudden onset of back pain that required immediate surgery. She returns 3 weeks later because of persistent left lower leg pain and a weak left ankle-jerk reflex. In addition to pain management, which of the following is the most appropriate step at this time?  ",AP and lateral x-ray films of the lumbosacral spine,CT scan of the lumbosacral spine,Diskography,MRI of the spine,Observation,,4,"The symptoms now suggest a radiculopathy because of the left lower extremity pain, and the weak left ankle-jerk reflex. Therefore, consideration of a disc bulge or herniation must be considered. The most effective diagnostic imaging of this region is an MRI of the lumbosacral spine, not an x-ray, CT scan, or diskography. Observation is inappropriate as she has symptoms of a radiculopathy and should be further evaluated with an MRI.",,
1271,4,Pediatrics,"A 10 year old boy is brought to the emergency department by his father because the boy is slightly lethargic and has labored breathing. The father, who is a single parent, reports that the boy is &quot;always thirsty&quot; and &quot;urinates a lot.&quot; The boy's pulse is 120/min, respirations are 32/min and blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg. Laboratory studies show: Na+ 132 mEq/LK+ 4.1 mEq/LCl 92 mEq/LHCO3 6.6 mEq/LGlucose 850 mg/dLThe boy is treated with intravenous insulin and isotonic saline solution. Several hours later, he is improved and his serum glucose concentration is 450 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?  ",Add glucose to this intravenous solution,Add potassium to this intravenous solution,Add sodium bicarbonate to this intravenous solution,Begin treatment with intermediate-acting insulin,,,2,"This boy obviously has diabetes mellitus. Treatment with insulin has reduced his serum glucose concentration, and there will also have been a concomitant shift of K+ from the extracellular compartment into the cells. Unless replaced, this loss will have dire consequences. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to add K+ to the intravenous fluid.",,
1272,1,Medicine,"A 28 year old woman who is known to be HIV positive comes to the emergency department because of increasing headaches, right-sided weakness and disorientation for the past week. A major motor (grand mal) seizure occurs shortly after admission. On physical examination following the seizure, vital signs are normal. There is no nuchal rigidity. Funduscopic examination shows papilledema. There is also right hemiparesis and aphasia. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  ",Meningioma,Meningococcal meningitis,Neurosyphilis,Toxoplasmosis,Tuberculous meningitis,,4,"The patient has CNS symptoms, and is HIV-positive. Some 15% of such patients have toxoplasmosis, making this the most likely diagnosis. The neurological symptoms of CNS toxoplasmosis will vary depending upon the site and severity of the infection. A glioblastoma, neurosyphilis, meningococcal, or tubercular meningitis could cause some or all of the symptoms, but given the patient's history, are much less likely than toxoplasmosis. Obviously the next step in management would be to confirm the diagnosis.",,
1273,1,Medicine,"A 38 year old nurse comes to the emergency department after leaving work early because of a horrible headache. She has had a cold with sinus congestion for the past week, and yesterday she began taking an over-the-counter combination of diphenhydramine and pseudoephedrine. She tells you she has a history of migraines, multiple allergies, premenstrual syndrome and depression, for which she takes phenelzine (a monoamine oxidase inhibitor). Vital signs are: temperature 37.2C (99.0F), pulse 90/min, respirations 16/min and blood pressure 210/118 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate action?  ","Administer meperidine, intramuscularly","Administer phentolamine, intravenously",Order CT scan of the head,Order transillumination of the sinuses,Prescribe oral oxycodone and nasal corticosteroids,,2,"This patient has hypertension secondary to the effects of the pseudoephedrine and her monoamine oxidase inhibitor. The inhibition of MAO-A causes the rise of norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin in the synaptic cleft, of MAOB only of dopamine. Pseudoephedrine displaces norepinephrine from synaptic terminals. For this reasons, nasal sprays such as the one this patient is taking are to be avoided when MAOIs are used. Phentolamine is a reversible alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker that will blunt the effects of the excess catecholamines on arteriolar vasoconstriction.",,
1274,6,Surgery," A 44 year old man sustained a comminuted fracture of his left tibia and fibula 4 months ago. For the past 3 months he has been in the rehabilitation unit with his leg fully immobilized. Three hours ago he suddenly developed chest pain and shortness of breath, and he has just been brought to the emergency department for further evaluation. On examination he describes an aching discomfort over the right superior anterior chest and the right scapula posteriorly. In questioning the patient further, an important point in the history would be the relationship of the pain to which of the following?  ",Change of position,Deep breathing,Eating,Swallowing,Walking,,2,"Three months of immobilization is like demanding a pulmonary embolus. It is surprising that it took so long, and that he is not yet moderately ambulatory. In this case, the patient has already flipped an embolus to his lung, and that area of the lung and the overlying pleura is infarcted. Hence, the pain and discomfort will be related to deep breathing, and not to change in position. Pain with eating and swallowing, odynophagia is more commonly encountered with lesions of the esophagus. Pain with walking, depending on the site, can be claudication in the lower extremities, or ischemia of the myocardium and chest pain.",,

On examination he describes an aching discomfort over the right superior anterior chest and the right scapula posteriorly. The family history is strongly positive for heart disease. The presence of a right pleural friction rub in this patient would suggest which of the following?  ",Pericarditis,Pneumonia,Pneumothorax,Pulmonary embolus with infarction,Pulmonary embolus without infarction,,4,"Pain and pleural frictional rub is almost diagnostic of infarction of the overlying pleura. Pericardial rub due to pericarditis is localized to the lower left side of the heart; there is no evidence for this diagnosis here. Pneumonia, which is another complication of immobility, may present with similar signs and symptoms, but should be accompanied with fever and leukocytosis. A pneumothorax and a pulmonary embolus without infarction do not typically present with a pleural friction rub.",,

On physical examination he has a temperature of 40.0C (104.0F) and marked nuchal rigidity. While awaiting the results of a lumbar puncture, which of the following is the most appropriate intravenous pharmacotherapy?  ",Ceftriaxone,Ciprofloxacin,Glucocorticoids,Penicillin,Ticarcillin,,1,"This patient has signs (nuchal rigidity) and symptoms (fever) of meningitis. The standard of care is to initiate antibiotic therapy immediately, even before a diagnostic lumbar puncture is taken. The antibiotic of choice must both cover the likely offending organism and have good penetration into the CSF. Ceftriaxone, a third generation cephalosporin meets both of these requirements.",,
1277,4,Pediatrics,"A 4 year old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents because of a swollen pinna. The father says that the boy fell off his tricycle in a playground. On physical examination the child's left ear is severely edematous and discolored. There is concern for the child because this is his third emergency department visit in the past 6 months. When discussing these concerns and the need for further evaluation with the parents, they become angry and want to take the child home now. It would be most appropriate to:  ",Arrange for the child to be admitted for evaluation and protection,Discharge the child to another relative or neighbor if available,Keep the child and initiate foster care placement,"Send the child home with his parents, but notify the police of the situation",Send the child home and arrange for a social worker to make a family assessment on a home visit,,1,"Most states have laws that mandate that a clinician who suspects physical or sexual abuse must act immediately, separating the child from the parents if necessary. Discharge to another relative or neighbor will not prevent the abusing parent from retrieving the child and inflicting further abuse. Foster care placement can only be applied for after there is proof of physical abuse. If your suspicions of abuse are high, do not send the child home with the parents under any circumstances. Again, sending the child home, even with an impending social work evaluation, leaves the child open for continued abuse. When angered, the abusing parent may inflict greater injury after a quiescent phase, resulting in death of the child. In a possible abuse case, the physician should take steps to both protect the child and investigate further.",,

On examination the patient is somewhat agitated and shows confusion for recent events. There is decreased pupillary response on the left with some paresis of lateral gaze on the right. Temperature is 38.3C (101.0F). Peripheral leukocyte count is increased.

Furthermore, the neurologic signs and symptoms described clearly indicate focal findings as would be seen with a mass lesion. In a homosexual man, one would suspect the possibility of toxoplasmosis, and a CT scan of the head should be performed. Toxoplasmosis would be revealed as multiple ring-enhancing lesions. Bilateral carotid angiography and an electroencephalogram are not indicated at this time. A lumbar puncture would in fact be contraindicated given the possibility of a mass lesion and possible increased intracranial pressure. While order a serum test for HIV antibodies may be appropriate it will not be most useful in evaluating his current signs and symptoms. intubation and intravenous antibiotic therapy.",,

1282,1,Medicine,A 59 year old man strikes the steering wheel of his car during a low speed automobile accident. In the emergency department he is alert and his vital signs are normal. He complains of mild tenderness on sternal compression. Chest x-ray film shows a widened mediastinum. The most appropriate first step is to order:  ,CT scan of the chest with contrast,Bronchoscopy,Thoracentesis,Thoracic ultrasonography,,,1,"A classic history such as this should always trigger a rule out diagnosis for aortic arch dissection. Traumatic dissection is very common in trauma situations and the classical description is a widened mediastinum on plain chest films. However, this finding is highly non-specific and therefore, CT imaging with contrast of the thorax is now the preferred method for ruling out this diagnosis. Bronchoscopy is used to assess the trachea and upper airways via direct visualization. It has no role in the evaluation of possible aortic injury. Thoracocentesis is used to evaluate fluid present in the pleural space, a so called pleural effusion. A needle is inserted lateral or inferior to the lung but within the pleural space to withdraw fluid for analysis. Thoracic ultrasonography could refer to imaging of the thorax or of the heart. Regardless, trans-thoracic ultrasound has limited ability to evaluate the aortic arch. A trans-esophageal ultrasound however is exquisitely sensitive for detecting aortic arch injury and allows complete inspection of the aortic root and valve, as well as the coronary cusps and sinuses.",,

On physical examination he is extremely restless and is in obvious pain. Genitalia are normal. Abdominal examination is normal except for intermittent guarding with spasms of pain. Plain x-ray film of the abdomen is normal. Urinalysis and urinary sediment are: pH 6.5, Specific gravity 1.025, Glucose negative, Protein negative. The most appropriate diagnostic study is: ",CT scan of the kidney,Culture of the urine,Determination of serum uric acid concentration,CT scan of the abdomen,Measurement of 24 hour urinary calcium excretion,,4,"The patient's clinical description is consistent with acute renal colic from nephrolithiasis. In addition, the picture clearly shows crystals. The stone is more likely to be found in the ureter. A CT scan of the abdomen is the most appropriate of the tests listed to find a ureteral stone. CT scanning of the kidney is not going to be the most helpful because the calculi are within the urinary tract, not necessarily within the kidneys. There is no description of dysuria, frequency, or burning and there is no fever described. This would go against the need for culture. Although evaluation for causes of crystalluria and kidney stones may be indicated in patients with nephrolithiasis, this is premature since we have not even found the stone yet to confirm the diagnosis.",,

On physical examination a systolic heart murmur is detected over the precordium. An expected physical finding will be which of the following?  ",Mid-systolic click,Increased intensity of the murmur with deep inspiration,Increased intensity of the murmur with forced expiration,Positive Kussmaul sign (rise in jugular venous pulse with inspiration),Right-sided gallop,,2,"An intravenous drug abuser with high fevers and a cardiac murmur should be considered to have acute bacterial endocarditis with staphylococcus until proven otherwise. The valvular lesion most commonly seen in these patients is tricuspid regurgitation. This is a systolic murmur and since it is located on the right side of the heart, it will increase in intensity with inspiration, which increases right heart filling.",,
1285,6,Surgery,"A 25 year old man comes to the emergency department because of pain, swelling and erythema over the metacarpophalangeal joint of the right long finger. Three days ago he struck an opponent in the mouth during an altercation. On physical examination there is an abrasion over the dorsal surface of the joint, pain on passive motion of the finger, and exquisite tenderness along the volar aspect of the finger and metacarpal. His temperature is 38.5&deg;C (101.3&deg;F). X-ray films are normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?  ",Splinting for 1 week followed by active range-of-motion exercises,Splinting for 3 weeks followed by active range-of-motion exercises,"Splinting, oral antibiotic therapy and reevaluation in 24 hours",Splinting and intravenous antibiotic therapy,Surgical debridement and intravenous antibiotic therapy,,5,"The history and physical findings suggest an infective arthritis of the metacarpophalangeal joint. This is most commonly from a puncture or cut on the dorsum of the hand; it is often seen when a fighter's fist strikes the tooth of his opponent, resulting not only in crushed tissue, but also in inoculation of organisms in the metacarpophalangeal joint, particularly into the metacarpal head. Wounds of human bites should be d&eacute;brided and irrigated, not sutured, and aggressive intravenous antibiotic therapy is immediately started. All of the other choices, including splinting and exercise, are usually indicated in fracture and dislocation of phalangeal and metacarpal bones. Splinting, antibiotics and reevaluation and splinting and antibiotic therapy are incorrect because he requires debridement.",,

He has used prochlorperazine suppositories for relief of nausea and vomiting. He now has severe muscle spasms in his neck. On physical examination there is sustained spasm of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles with twisting of his head to the right. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time?  ,Chlorzoxazone,Dantrolene,Diazepam,Diphenhydramine,Methocarbamol,,4,"The trick to this question is recognizing that that prochlorperazine is a directive of the antipsychotic medications (neuroleptics) such as chlorpromazine, thioridazine, and fluphenazine. Thus, it is capable of causing similar dystonic reactions, including sustained twisting of the head to the right (torticollis), impaired breathing (laryngospasm), and eyes deviated up, down, or sideways (oculogyric crisis). Diphenhydramine, 25-50 mg given intramuscularly, will relieve the symptoms of a dystonic reaction.",,

Neuropsychiatric changes such as poor concentration, memory loss, depression, anxiety. Genital symptoms such as vaginal and vulvar dryness and thinning, which may result in inflammation of the vaginal mucosa (atrophic vaginitis). Also there is risk of osteoporosis increases because estrogen is decreased, increasing bone resorption by osteoclasts.Regression (not increase) of breast size during and after menopause is psychologically distressing to some women.

As a result, the person has some or all of the physical characteristics of a woman, despite having the genetic makeup of a man.In its classic form (complete androgen resistance), the person appears to be female but has no uterus, and has sparse armpit and pubic hair. At puberty, female secondary sex characteristics (e.g., breasts) develop, but menstruation and fertility do not.Incomplete AIS, however, is often discovered during childhood because a person may have both male and female physical characteristics. Many have partial fusion of the outer vaginal lips, an enlarged clitoris, and a short, blind-ending vagina.The Mllerian ducts will develop to form the fallopian tubes, uterus, and the upper portion of the vagina. The Wolffian duct develops into a system of connected organs between the testis and the prostate, the epididymis, the vas deferens, the seminal vesicle, and the prostate. Both of these ducts will be absent in AIS.",,

The SCJ is the visible border between the squamous and columnar epithelia of the cervix and represents the new squamocolumnar junction. It is adjacent to the new SCJ that the dynamic process of squamous metaplasia occurs throughout the reproductive years. This is a normal process during which columnar epithelium is replaced by squamous. The trigger for this process is thought to be the eversion of the columnar epithelium under the influence of estrogen and its subsequent exposure to the acidic vaginal pH. In response to the insult of vaginal acidity, the process of metaplasia replaces the more fragile columnar epithelium with the more sturdy squamous type.",,

",Fat embolism ,Post operative infection ,Post operative fever,DVT,,,1,"Fat embolism can cause acute respiratory failure after long-bone fractures. It is thought to be caused by deposition of embolic fat within the pulmonary capillaries, resulting in a capillary leak within the lung. The source of the embolic fat appears to be marrow fat. Alterations in circulating free fatty acids, increases in fibrin split products, and increases in platelet adhesiveness have been observed to occur in this syndrome and probably play an important part in the production of the pulmonary lesion. The signs and symptoms of the syndrome are hypoxemia, tachypnea, petechiae, fever, altered sensorium, and chest x-rays similar to signs of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Early recognition is facilitated by monitoring of arterial blood gas levels for hypoxemia. Treatment is directed at ARDS using graduated oxygen therapy and steroids.",,

Engaging in sexual activity at a young age is one such factor. The cells lining the cervix do not fully mature until the age of 18 and, therefore, are more susceptible to cancer causing-agents and viruses.More than 90% of women with cancer of the cervix are infected with the human papilloma virus (HPV). HPV is the single most important factor for cervical cancer. HPV usually causes warts in the genital area. The viruses are passed from one person to another during unprotected sex. Having multiple sexual partners increases one's risk of getting this cancer, because the greater number of sexual partners, the greater is the risk of acquiring HPV infection. Even if a woman has only one sexual partner, but the man has several partners, he is considered a &quot;high-risk male&quot; and can transmit HPV to the women.Smoking is considered a risk factor, possibly because smoking causes some abnormal changes in the cells and these cells have a higher likelihood of becoming cancerous. There are also some statistical studies that have suggested that long-term use of oral contraceptives may put a woman at a slightly higher risk of developing this cancer.",,

On bimanual exam, she has a small, retroverted uterus and tender nodules can be felt on palpation of the uterosacral ligaments. Which of the following conditions does she most likely have? ",Chronic PID,Adenomyosis,Fibroids,Endometriosis,Uterine carcinoma,,4,"Endometriosis is a condition in which bits of tissue from the lining of the uterus (endometrium) grow outside the uterus. The endometrial tissue, called an endometrial implant, usually adheres to the pelvic organs, which include the ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, the cavity behind the uterus, and the ligaments that support the uterus. Endometrial implants may also adhere to the tubes leading from the kidneys to the bladder, the bladder, the vagina, the outer surface of the small and large intestine, or the lining of the chest cavity. Endometriosis progresses slowly. So, a woman may have the disease but not experience any symptoms for years. There is no link between the severity of the symptoms and the severity of the disease. Some women have great pain, but very few endometrial implants. The most common symptoms include pain in the lower abdomen during the menstrual period, spotting between periods, heavy or irregular periods, pain during intercourse, pain during bowel movements or urination, and lower back pain. Many women with endometriosis experience infertility because the endometrial implants block the passage of the egg from the ovary to the uterus. Diagnoses is aided by a pelvic exam to feel for endometrial implants. The best way to diagnosis this disease, however, is through a procedure called laparoscopy.",,

During the process, increased platelet aggregation and coagulation factor consumption occur. DIC that evolves slowly (over weeks or months) causes primarily venous thrombotic and embolic manifestations; DIC that evolves rapidly (over hours or days) causes primarily bleeding. DIC occurs in the following clinical circumstances:Complications of obstetricseg, abruptio placentae (most common), saline-induced therapeutic abortion, retained dead fetus or products of conception, or amniotic fluid embolism. Placental tissue with tissue factor activity enters or is exposed to the maternal circulation.Infection, particularly with gram-negative organisms.

",Estradiol,Blood glucose,Testosterone,LH:FSH,DHEA,,2,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by mild obesity, irregular menses or amenorrhea, and signs of androgen excess (hirsutism, acne). Typically, the ovaries contain multiple cysts. Diagnosis is by pregnancy testing, hormone level measurement, and imaging to exclude a virilizing tumor. Testing includes pregnancy testing and measurement of serum estradiol, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Diagnosis is confirmed by ultrasonography showing &gt; 10 follicles per ovary; follicles usually occur in the periphery and resemble a string of pearls.If ovarian follicles or hirsutism is present, serum testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels are measured.LH/FSH ratio is more important than LH by itself. The ratio is normally about 1:1 in premenopausal women, but with PCOS a ratio of greater than 2:1 or 3:1 may be considered diagnostic.PCOS is also associated with peripheral insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, and obesity amplifies the degree of both abnormalities, but serum glucose levels will not specifically affect the PCOS diagnosis.

As a result, the person has some or all of the physical characteristics of a woman, despite having the genetic makeup of a man.In its classic form (complete androgen resistance), the person appears to be female but has no uterus, and has sparse armpit and pubic hair. At puberty, female secondary sex characteristics (e.g., breasts) develop, but menstruation and fertility do not.Incomplete AIS, however, is often discovered during childhood because a person may have both male and female physical characteristics. Many have partial fusion of the outer vaginal lips, an enlarged clitoris, and a short, blind-ending vagina.The individual is often diagnosed because of ambiguous genitalia. Sometimes, though, the person has primarily male characteristics and the only symptom is a low sperm count as an adult, perhaps with breast enlargement.",,

Because of its tissue selectivity, raloxifene may have fewer side effects than are typically observed with estrogen therapy. The most common adverse effects of raloxifene are hot flushes and leg cramps. The drug is also associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events. The beneficial estrogenic activities of raloxifene include a lowering of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and an augmentation of bone mineral density.

The choice of pill formulation is influenced by clinical considerations. By choosing appropriately from the available pill formulations, physicians can minimize negative side effects and maximize noncontraceptive benefits for their patients. Additional monitoring and follow-up are necessary in special populations, such as women over 35 years of age, smokers, perimenopausal women and adolescents. Third-generation progestins are additional options for achieving noncontraceptive benefits, but their use has raised new questions about thrombogenesis. Whereas only one of 1,000 women who take oral contraceptive pills perfectly becomes pregnant within a year, 50 of 1,000 women who take the pills typically become pregnant within one year.",,

Symptoms and signs include thirst, lethargy, dry mucosa, decreased urine output, and, as the degree of dehydration progresses, tachycardia, hypotension, and shock. Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination. Treatment is best approached by considering separately the fluid resuscitation requirements, current deficit, ongoing losses, and maintenance requirements. The volume (eg, amount of fluid), composition, and rate of replacement differ for each. Formulas and estimates used to determine treatment parameters provide a starting place, but treatment requires ongoing monitoring of vital signs, clinical appearance, urine output and specific gravity, weight, and sometimes serum electrolyte levels. Children with severe dehydration (eg, evidence of circulatory compromise) should receive fluids IV. Those unable or unwilling to drink or who have repetitive vomiting can receive fluid replacement IV, through an NGT, or sometimes orally through frequently repeated small amounts.",,

ADHD-specific questionnaires can help determine whether children meet diagnostic criteria for the disorder. The recommended evaluation also includes documenting the type and severity of ADHD symptoms, verifying the presence of normal vision and hearing, screening for comorbid psychologic conditions, reviewing the child's developmental history and school performance, and applying objective measures of cognitive function. The stimulants methylphenidate (Ritalin) and dextroamphetamine remain the pharmacologic agents of first choice for the management of ADHD. These agents are equally effective in improving the core symptoms of the disorder, but individual children may respond better to one stimulant medication than to another. Achievement of maximal benefit may require titration of the initial dosage and dosing before breakfast, before lunch and in the afternoon. Mental retardation is not a component of ADHD.",,

",Amoxicillin,Azithromycin (Zithromax),Dextromethorphan,Nasal bulb suction,Pseudoephedrine,,4,"Prescribing antibiotics for viral upper respiratory infections is inappropriate and is discouraged by all evidence-based recommendations. Over-the-counter medications have often been recommended as an alternative to antibiotics, but recently concerns have been raised about their use in young children. Early in 2007 the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) released a report about the use of over-the-counter cold medications in children less than 2 years of age. The report reminds practitioners that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved any dosing regimens for these medications in young children, since their effectiveness has not been proven and the risks for toxicity are not adequately known in this age group. It was reported that 1519 children were treated in emergency departments in 2005 for adverse events related to these medications, including some overdoses and at least three deaths.The 2007 report adds to similar warnings on the use of over-the-counter cold medications in young children from the Academy of Pediatrics and the College of Chest Physicians.

All 3 measures help establish the severity of an exacerbation and document treatment response. PEF values are interpreted in light of the patient's personal best, which may vary widely among patients who are equally well controlled. A 15 to 20% reduction from this baseline indicates a significant exacerbation. When baseline values are not known, the percent predicted value gives a general idea of airflow limitation but not the individual patient's degree of worsening.Chest x-ray is not necessary for most exacerbations but should be obtained in patients with symptoms suggestive of pneumonia or pneumothorax. ABG measurements should be obtained in patients with marked respiratory distress or signs and symptoms of impending respiratory failure.",,

",Kawasaki disease,Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome,Stevens-Johnson syndrome,Toxic epidermal necrolysis,Toxic shock syndrome,,2,"Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is an acute epidermolysis caused by a staphylococcal toxin. Newborns and children are most susceptible. Symptoms are widespread bullae with epidermal sloughing. The initial lesion is usually superficial and crusted. Within 24 h, the surrounding skin becomes painful and scarlet, changes that quickly spread to other areas. The skin may be exquisitely tender and have a wrinkled tissue paper&ndash;like consistency. Large, flaccid blisters arise on the erythematous skin and quickly break to produce erosions. Intact blisters extend laterally with gentle pressure (Nikolsky's sign). The epidermis may peel easily, often in large sheets. Widespread desquamation occurs within 36 to 72 h, and patients become very ill with systemic manifestations (eg, malaise, chills, fever). Desquamated areas appear scalded. Loss of the protective skin barrier can lead to sepsis and to fluid and electrolyte imbalance.Diagnosis is by examination and sometimes biopsy.

Children under the age of 2 should not be given low-fat milk (2%, 1%, or skim) as they need the additional calories from fat to ensure proper growth and development.Children under the age of 1 should not be given whole milk as it has been shown to cause low blood counts. Cheese, cottage cheese, and yogurt, however, may be given in small amounts. The 1 year old child should be getting much of their nutrition from meats, fruits and vegetables, breads and grains, and the dairy group, especially whole milk.Providing a variety of foods will help to ensure enough vitamins and minerals.

Signs and symptoms include feeding intolerance, lethargy, temperature instability, ileus, bloating, bilious emesis, hematochezia, reducing substances in the stool, apnea, and sometimes signs of sepsis. In infants who develop NEC, 3 intestinal factors are usually present: a preceding ischemic insult, bacterial colonization, and intraluminal substrate (ie, enteral feedings).Etiology is believed that an ischemic insult damages the intestinal lining, leading to increased intestinal permeability and leaving the intestine susceptible to bacterial invasion. Once feedings are begun, ample substrate is present for proliferation of luminal bacteria, which can penetrate the damaged intestinal wall, producing hydrogen gas. The gas may collect within the intestinal wall (pneumatosis intestinalis) or enter the portal veins.Diagnosis is clinical and is confirmed by imaging studies. Treatment is primarily supportive and includes nasogastric suction, parenteral fluids, TPN, antibiotics, isolation in cases of infection, and, often, surgery.",,

Children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy are more likely to develop asthma. In Canada, children in urban environments are more likely to develop asthma, particularly if they are from lower socioeconomic groups. Although asthma affects a higher percentage of black children than white, the role that genetic aspects of race play in the increasing rate of asthma is controversial because black children are also more likely to live in urban areas. Children who are exposed to high concentrations of allergens, such as dust mites or cockroach feces, at an early age are more likely to develop asthma.

1334,4,Pediatrics,"A 5 year old girl with hypogammaglobulinemia and absent immunoglobulin A (IgA) receives infusions of immune globulin monthly. Shortly after her most recent infusion began, she developed hypotension, wheezing, and several urticarial lesions. Which of the following best explains her reaction? ",Anaphylactic reaction due to IgE anti-IgA antibodies,Gram-negative sepsis due to contaminated immune globulin,Idiosyncratic reaction due to rapid infusion of immune globulin,Serum sickness reaction from foreign serum in the immune globulin,Transfusion reaction due to ABO incompatibility,,1,"Anaphylaxis is triggered the same way other allergies are: the immune system, which serves as the body's defense against potentially dangerous substances such as germs, overreacts to a harmless substance (an allergen) and in that process can damage the body. As part of the normal immune response, proteins called antibodies are produced that can detect and help destroy &ldquo;invaders&rdquo; in the body. A specific antibody called Immunoglobulin E, or IgE, is responsible for the adverse reactions in people with allergies. When allergens first enter the body of a person predisposed to allergies, the immune system produces the allergen-specific IgE antibodies. The IgE antibodies attach themselves to the surface of cells called mast cells. The next time that allergic individual comes into contact with the allergen, the IgE identifies it and quickly initiates the release of chemicals, such as histamine, from the mast cells. These potent chemicals cause the symptoms seen in allergic reactions and anaphylaxis.",,

For most patients and procedures, a single dose shortly before the procedure is effective.Procedures requiring antimicrobial endocarditis prophylaxis include oral-dental procedures, dental extraction, dental implant placement and reimplantation of avulsed teeth and periodontal procedures, including surgery, scaling, root planing, and probing.Drug treatment in patients allergic to penicillin is with a macrolide such as erythromycin, clarithromycin or azithromycin.",,
1336,4,Pediatrics,Which of the following statements about stuttering in a 4 year old is incorrect? ,It is characterized by intermittent difficulty in producing a smooth flow of speech,It is more than 3 times more frequent in girls than in boys,It is exacerbated by anxiety,More than 30% of children who stutter recover spontaneously,,,2,"The etiology of stuttering is controversial. The prevailing theories point to measurable neurophysical dysfunctions that disrupt the precise timing required to produce speech. Stuttering is a common disorder that usually resolves by adulthood. Almost 80 percent of children who stutter recover fluency by the age of 16 years. As with many behavioral disorders of childhood, stuttering occurs three to four times more often in boys than in girls. Mild stuttering is self-limited, but more severe stuttering requires speech therapy, which is the mainstay of treatment. Delayed auditory feedback and computer-assisted training are currently used to help slow down speech and control other speech mechanisms. Pharmacologic therapy is seldom used, although haloperidol has been somewhat effective.",,

Behavioral changes may involve sexual acting out, aggression, depression, eating disturbances and regression. Because the examination findings of most child victims of sexual abuse are within normal limits or are nonspecific, the child's statements are extremely important. In most cases, the adult is known to the child and may be a family member, stepparent, or a person with authority (eg, a teacher). The child's history as obtained by the physician may be admitted as evidence in court trials; therefore, complete documentation of questions and answers is critical. A careful history should be obtained and a thorough physical examination should be performed with documentation of all findings. When examining the child's genitalia, it is important that the physician be familiar with normal variants, nonspecific changes and diagnostic signs of sexual abuse. Judicious use of laboratory tests, along with appropriate therapy, should be individually tailored. Forensic evidence collection is indicated in certain cases.",,

Initial symptoms are nonspecific: fever, headache, and malaise. Within days, encephalitis (furious rabies; in 80%) or paralysis (dumb rabies; in 20%) develops. Encephalitis causes restlessness, confusion, agitation, bizarre behavior, hallucinations, and insomnia.Diagnosis is by serologic tests or biopsy. Vaccination is indicated for people at high risk of exposure. Postexposure prophylaxis involves wound care and passive and active immunoprophylaxis. The disorder is almost universally fatal. Treatment is supportive.",,

Some factors that increase a child's risk for middle ear infections include crowded living or daycare conditions, exposure to second-hand smoke, respiratory illnesses, close contact with siblings who have colds or ear infections, having a cleft palate, allergies that cause congestion on a chronic basis.",,
1341,4,Pediatrics,"A 13 month old infant boy has chronic diarrhea, poor appetite, irritability and growth failure. He had been well previously, developing normally until diarrhea began at 3 months of age. Findings include weight loss less than 5th percentile and length at 25th percentile, cachectic appearance, wasted extremities and protuberant abdomen. His labs are: albumin 23, protein 40. Stool positive for reducing sugars and negative for enteric pathogens and ova and parasites. These findings are most consistent with: ",Celiac disease,Cow milk allergy,Crohn disease,Cystic Fibrosis,Physical abuse,,1,"Celiac disease is characterized by inflammation of the upper small intestine in response to dietary gluten. The endomysial antibody test has led to improvements in the diagnosis of celiac disease. Minimal or atypical symptoms occur in many patients, especially those presenting with the disease in adulthood. Severe symptoms are most common in young children. A fulminant form, characterized by diarrhea, failure to thrive, abdominal distention and vomiting, occurs in children younger than two years of age. The median age at the time of diagnosis in children is four years, and loss of appetite is a common symptom. Duodenal mucosa histology changes in celiac disease are documented while on a gluten-containing diet and are characterized by a progressive deterioration of the villous architecture associated with a progressive increase in crypt length and density. Biopsy samples are now almost universally obtained by endoscopy. Multiple biopsy samples (at least 4) are recommended because celiac disease may be patchy and areas of villous atrophy may be adjacent to normal areas. Although endoscopically visible changes have been described (eg, scalloping or nodularity of the mucosa, sparse duodenal folds), such changes are neither constant nor specific, and a diagnosis of celiac disease should never be based on their presence or absence.The clinical and laboratory response to a gluten-free diet is documented. In particular, the positive autoantibodies (anti-tTG or antiendomysium antibodies) must progressively normalize.In clinical practice, serologic tests for celiac disease are useful in identifying children who require intestinal biopsy findings to diagnose the condition. In addition, these serologic test findings are supportive of the diagnosis in those with characteristic histopathologic features of celiac disease on small intestinal biopsy findings and may have a role in monitoring response to treatment. Numerous serologic tests are now commercially available.",,
1342,4,Pediatrics,"All infants less than 2 months of age who have fever and no localizing signs should have all of the following evaluations, except: ",Blood cultures,Spinal tap,Chest x-ray,CBC (with differential),Urine culture,,3,"In infants younger than 2 months of age who have a fever, you may order blood and urine tests and perform a spinal tap to look for occult bacteremia, urinary tract infection, and meningitis. The reason for these tests is that in infants, the source of fever is difficult to determine. They are also at risk of serious infection compared with older children because of their immature immune system. You may also order an x-ray if the infant's breathing is abnormal. For infants older than 2 months of age, testing may not be needed, but you might want to order blood and urine tests and perform a spinal tap if the source of the fever is not obvious and the child appears ill.",,
1343,4,Pediatrics,"All the following statements regarding transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is true, except: ",Infants born by C-section are at increased risk for developing TTN,Residual pulmonary function disability is common among infants who have TTN,The incidence of TTN is higher than Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) among term infants,TTN shows marked improvement with 12-24 hrs,Chest x-ray findings consistent with TTN include increased pulmonary vasculature and fluid in the fissures,,2,"Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is respiratory distress caused by delayed resorption of fetal lung fluid. TTN affects premature infants, term infants delivered by cesarean section, and infants born with respiratory depression, all of whom have delayed clearance of fetal lung fluid. Maternal diabetes and asthma are also risk factors, for unknown reasons, and the disorder can occur in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and in term infants born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid.Rapid respirations, grunting, and retractions begin soon after delivery, and cyanosis may develop. Chest x-ray shows hyperinflated lungs with streaky perihilar markings, giving the appearance of a shaggy heart border while the periphery of the lungs is clear. Fluid is often seen in the lung fissures.Recovery usually occurs within 2 to 3 days. Treatment is supportive and involves giving O2 by hood and monitoring ABGs or pulse oximetry. Rarely, extremely premature infants and/or those with neurologic depression at birth require continuous positive airway pressure and occasionally even mechanical ventilation.",,

Diagnosis is based on applying the Jones criteria to information from history, examination, and laboratory testing. Rheumatic fever can be prevented in a case of strep pharyngitis by giving penicillin. Even when started as late as 9 days after the onset of pharyngitis, penicillin effectively prevents primary attacks of acute rheumatic fever.",,
1347,2,OBGYN,Fetal tricuspid valve abnormalities are associated with maternal use of which of the following,Lithium,Warfarin,Chloramphenicol,Estrogen,Heroin,,1,"Ebstein's anomaly, also called Ebstein's malformation, is a heart defect in which the tricuspid valve is abnormally formed. The tricuspid valve normally has three &quot;flaps&quot; or leaflets. In Ebstein's anomaly, one or two of the three leaflets are stuck to the wall of the heart and don't move normally. Often there's also a hole in the wall between the atria, the heart's two upper chambers. This hole is called an atrial septal defect or ASD. Because the tricuspid valve is malformed in Ebstein's anomaly, it often doesn't work properly and may leak. If the valve leaks, some of the blood pumped by the right ventricle goes backwards through the valve with each heartbeat. Studies suggest that lithium might be involved as a teratogen increasing the incidence of Ebstein's anomaly in the offspring of female patients with manic-depressive psychosis and lithium-administered during pregnancy.",,
1348,4,Pediatrics,Which of the following is most likely to provide the basis for making the correct diagnosis in an infant or child who has failure to thrive (FTT)? ,Blood chemistries,Cultures,History and physical,Radiograph studies,,,3,"Failure to thrive is weight consistently below the 3rd to the 5th percentile for age, progressive decrease in weight to below the 3rd to the 5th percentile, or a decrease in the percentile rank of 2 major growth parameters in a short period. The cause may be an identified medical condition or related to environmental factors. Both types relate to inadequate nutrition. Treatment aims to restore proper nutrition. Up to 80% of children with growth failure do not have an apparent growth-inhibiting (organic) disorder; growth failure occurs because of environmental neglect (eg, lack of food) or stimulus deprivation.Lack of food may be due to impoverishment, poor understanding of feeding techniques, improperly prepared formula (eg, overdiluting formula to stretch it because of financial difficulties), or an inadequate supply of breast milk (eg, because the mother is under stress, exhausted, or poorly nourished).Nonorganic FTT is often a complex of disordered interaction between a child and caregiver. The unstimulated child becomes depressed, apathetic, and ultimately anorexic. Stimulation may be lacking because the caregiver is depressed or apathetic, has poor parenting skills, is anxious about or unfulfilled by the caregiving role, feels hostile toward the child, or is responding to real or perceived external stresses (eg, demands of other children in large or chaotic families, marital dysfunction, a significant loss, financial difficulties).",,
1349,4,Pediatrics,An 8 year old boy has had paroxysmal abdominal pain since his parents separated 6 months ago. Which of the following symptoms would support an organic basis for his disease? ,Headaches accompanies the pain,Pain located in the periumbilical region,Pain awakens child at night,Symptoms last  1 hour,,,3,"Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) is common in children especially in pre-school children and adolescents. Recurrent abdominal pain is an expression of physiological maladjustments in response to family or school problems in predisposed children. Contrary to this belief, many studies have found organic causes of RAP to be more common. The occurrence of nocturnal pain is considered an important indicator of an organic (disease-based). Night pain or pain on awakening suggests a peptic origin, while pain that occurs in the evening or during dinner is a feature of constipation.Organic causes include (but are not limited to) gastrointestinal disease, urinary tract infections, parasite infestation and esophagitis/gastritis.",,
1350,4,Pediatrics,Which of the following is usually an acute cause rather than chronic cause of diarrhea in a child? ,Infectious diarrhea,Inflammatory bowel disease,Cystic fibrosis,Celiac disease,,,1,"Acute diarrhea is most likely infectious, especially if onset is sudden or accompanied by vomiting, bloody stools, fever, anorexia, or listlessness. Diagnosis is clinical, and treatment is supportive until the condition resolves spontaneously.Chronic diarrhea is usually more significant. Causes include gluten-induced enteropathy (celiac disease), cystic fibrosis, sugar malabsorption, and allergic gastroenteropathy. Inflammatory bowel disease and some infections (eg, with Giardia) can also cause chronic diarrhea.",,
1351,4,Pediatrics,Which of the following is not required for a diagnosis of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis? ,Arthritis in at least one joint,Arthritis lasting for at least 6 weeks,Positive rheumatoid factor,Onset before the age of 16,Other causes of arthritis excluded,,3,"Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) should be suspected in children with symptoms of arthritis, signs of iridocyclitis, generalized adenopathy, splenomegaly, or unexplained fever lasting more than a few days, or rash. Diagnosis is primarily clinical. Patients suspected of having JRA should be tested for rheumatoid factor (RF), antinuclear antibodies (ANA), and ESR as these tests may be helpful in diagnosing JRA and distinguishing its subtypes. In Still's disease, RF and ANA are absent. In pauciarticular-onset JRA, ANA are present in up to 75%. In polyarticular-onset JRA, RF usually is negative, but in some patients, mostly adolescent girls, it can be positive.",,
1352,4,Pediatrics,A child presents with bilateral shin pain. Which of the following suggests that this is not growing pains? ,Pain is poorly localized,Pain awakens the child at night,No fever or rash,Pain abates with reassurance and massage,Child may limp in the morning from stiffness,,5,"Growing pains are a common complaint of adolescents. Usually found in young men and women around the ages of 9 to 14, growing pains are the result of the rapid growth of these adolescents. Several conditions such as Osgood-Schlatter Disease, and Sever's Disease, are types of growing pains. These conditions are caused by inflammation around sites where large tendons insert. These tendons pull on the growing bone (at the growth plate) and cause inflammation. Growing pains are almost always seen in active youths, often while participating in sports. Growing pains are best treated with rest, stretching, and ice packs. If activities are causing significant growing pains, they should be avoided until the symptoms resolve. Growing pains are not usually associated with a limp.",,
1353,4,Pediatrics,Which of the following statements about precocious puberty is true? ,The cause is never found in most cases,The children are always shorter than average,The incidence is the same for males and females,Ketoconazole is the treatment of choice for females,All girls with breast development before age 10 require karyotyping for Turner syndrome,,1,"Precocious puberty is onset of sexual maturation before age 8 in girls or age 9 in boys. The onset of puberty is normally triggered by the hypothalamus (the area of the brain that helps control pituitary gland function). It signals the pituitary gland (a pea-sized gland near the base of the brain) to release hormones that stimulate the ovaries (in girls) or testicles (in boys) to make sex hormones.Sometimes, precocious puberty stems from a structural problem in the brain (such as a tumor), brain injury due to head trauma, an infection (such as meningitis), or a problem in the ovaries or thyroid gland that triggers the onset of puberty ahead of schedule - but this usually isn't the case.For the majority of girls, there's no underlying medical problem - they simply start puberty too early for no known reason. In boys, the condition is less common, and more likely to be associated with an underlying medical problem than it is in girls.In about 5% of boys, precocious puberty is inherited. Starting puberty early can be passed to the son from the father or to the son from the maternal grandfather through the mother (who will not be affected by the disorder). But less than 1% of girls affected by precocious puberty have inherited the condition.",,
1354,4,Pediatrics,Which of the following steps is not indicated in the management of croup? ,Keeping the child calm,Hydration,Antipyretics,Antibiotics,Humidified oxygen,,4,"Croup is acute inflammation of the upper and lower respiratory tracts caused most commonly by parainfluenza virus type 1 infection. It is characterized by a barking cough and inspiratory stridor. Diagnosis is usually obvious clinically but can be made by anteroposterior neck x-ray. Treatment is antipyretics, hydration, nebulized racemic epinephrine, and corticosteroids. If O2 saturation falls  92%, humidified O2 should be administered.",,
1355,4,Pediatrics,A 5 year old boy frequently wets his bed with foul smelling urine. His parents are concerned and would like to know what they can do to prevent this. After obtaining a complete history and physical examination which of the following is an appropriate next step? ,Urinalysis,Prescribe DDAVP (desmopressin),Prescribe imipramine,Imaging of the urinary system,Give a bed-wetting alarm,,1,"Nocturnal enuresis is a common problem that can be troubling for children and their families. Recent studies indicate that nocturnal enuresis is best regarded as a group of conditions with different etiologies. A genetic component is likely in many affected children. Research also indicates the possibility of two subtypes of patients with nocturnal enuresis: those with a functional bladder disorder and those with a maturational delay in nocturnal arginine vasopressin secretion. During the second year of life, children start to develop the ability to voluntarily relax the external urethral sphincter and initiate voiding, even in the absence of the desire to void. By approximately age 4 years, all children with normal bladder function should have acquired this ability.The evaluation of nocturnal enuresis requires a thorough history, a complete physical examination, and urinalysis. Urinalysis is the most important screening test in a child with enuresis.Treatment options include nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic measures. Continence training should be incorporated into the treatment regimen. Use of a bed-wetting alarm has the highest cure rate and the lowest relapse rate; however, some families may have difficulty with this treatment approach. Desmopressin and imipramine are the primary medications used to treat nocturnal enuresis, but both are associated with relatively high relapse rates.",,
1356,4,Pediatrics,An 8 year old boy presents with a cut with swelling on his arm. His physical exam also shows swollen lymph nodes. His mother tells you that he was most likely scratched by their neighbours cat. Which of the following organisms is most likely involved? ,Brucella canis,Sarcoptes scabiei,Chlamydia psittaci,Bartonella henselae,,,4,"Cat-scratch disease is infection caused by Bartonella henselae. Symptoms are a local papule and regional lymphadenitis. Within 3 to 10 days after a scratch, most patients develop an erythematous, crusted papule (rarely, a pustule) at the scratch site. Regional lymphadenopathy develops within 2 weeks. The nodes are initially firm and tender, later becoming fluctuant, and may drain with fistula formation. Fever, malaise, headache, and anorexia may accompany lymphadenopathy.Treatment is local heat application and analgesics. If a lymph node is fluctuant, needle aspiration usually relieves the pain. Antibiotic treatment is not clearly beneficial and generally should not be given for localized infection.",,
1357,4,Pediatrics,A newborn is noted to have a loud holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border. He also has episodes of difficulty breathing and has not been feeding well. Which of the following congenital heart defects does he most likely have? ,ASD,VSD,PDA,Tetralogy of Fallot,Coarctation of the aorta,,2,"A ventricular septal defect is one or more openings in the interventricular septum, producing a shunt between ventricles. Large defects result in a significant left-to-right shunt and produce dyspnea with feeding and poor growth. A loud, harsh, holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border is common. Recurrent respiratory infections and heart failure may develop. Diagnosis is by echocardiography. Defects may close spontaneously during infancy or require surgical repair.",,
1358,4,Pediatrics,"All of the following are appropriate in the initial assessment of a child with failure to thrive, except: ",Diet history,Social history,"Measurement of height, weight and head circumference",Growth hormone levels,Bone age x-ray,,4,"Failure to thrive is a condition commonly seen by primary care physicians. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are important for preventing malnutrition and developmental sequelae. Medical and social factors often contribute to failure to thrive. Either extreme of parental attention (neglect or hypervigilance) can lead to failure to thrive. About 25 percent of normal infants will shift to a lower growth percentile in the first two years of life and then follow that percentile; this should not be diagnosed as failure to thrive. Infants with Down syndrome, intrauterine growth retardation, or premature birth follow different growth patterns than normal infants. Many infants with failure to thrive are not identified unless careful attention is paid to plotting growth parameters at routine checkups. A thorough history is the best guide to establishing the etiology of the failure to thrive and directing further evaluation and management. All children with failure to thrive need additional calories for catch-up growth (typically 150 percent of the caloric requirement for their expected, not actual, weight). Few need laboratory evaluation. Hospitalization is rarely required and is indicated only for severe failure to thrive and for those whose safety is a concern. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended when failure to thrive persists despite intervention or when it is severe.",,
1359,4,Pediatrics,Which of the following statements about a child with short stature is correct? ,The bone age is delayed in a child with constitutional growth delay,Height crosses a major percentile line on the child's growth chart,Weight is more affected than height in a child with an endocrine deficiency,Karyotyping is part of the routine investigation of all children with short stature,Growth hormone replacement is helpful in a child with familial growth delay,,1,"Children with constitutional growth delay (CGD), the most common cause of short stature and pubertal delay, typically have retarded linear growth within the first 3 years of life. In this variant of normal growth, linear growth velocity and weight gain slows beginning as young as age 3-6 months, resulting in downward crossing of growth percentiles, which often continues until age 2-3 years. At that time, growth resumes at a normal rate, and these children grow either along the lower growth percentiles or beneath the curve but parallel to it for the remainder of the prepubertal years.CGD is a global delay in development that affects every organ system. Delays in growth and sexual development are quantified by skeletal age, which is determined from bone age radiographic studies of the left hand and wrist. Growth and development are appropriate for an individual's biologic age (skeletal age) rather than for their chronologic age.

Which of the following statements is false? ,It may be precipitated by a family crisis,It does not require a specific treatment,It can lead to poor self esteem,Bed-wetting alarm has the lowest relapse rate.,It can be secondary to diseases such as diabetes mellitus,,2,"Nocturnal enuresis is a common problem that can be troubling for children and their families. A genetic component is likely in many affected children. Research also indicates the possibility of two subtypes of patients with nocturnal enuresis: those with a functional bladder disorder and those with a maturational delay in nocturnal arginine vasopressin secretion. The evaluation of nocturnal enuresis requires a thorough history, a complete physical examination, and urinalysis. Treatment options include nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic measures. Continence training should be incorporated into the treatment regimen. Use of a bed-wetting alarm has the highest cure rate and the lowest relapse rate; however, some families may have difficulty with this treatment approach. Desmopressin and imipramine are the primary medications used to treat nocturnal enuresis, but both are associated with relatively high relapse rates.",,
1361,4,Pediatrics,Which of the following is not correct about the pertussis vaccine? ,Delaying the primary series until the age of 1 year will not reduce the risk of a seizure,"The commonly quoted risk of 1:330,000 of brain damage has no basis in fact",It can cause febrile seizures,It may cause infantile spasms or sudden infant death syndrome,The risk of other forms of neurologic illness eg. Transverse myelitis is extremely small,,4,"Although serious systemic adverse events such as hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes can still occur, they are much less common than with DTPw. Pertussis vaccine does not cause infantile spasms, epilepsy or sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Vaccine-induced fever may occasionally lead to a febrile convulsion, though much less commonly with DTPa than with DTPw.",,
1362,4,Pediatrics,The most common cause of apnea in infants less than 6 months is: ,Encephalitis,Seizure disorder,Cardiac arrhythmia,Milk allergy,Gastroesophageal reflux,,5,"The most common cause of apnea in infants is gastroesophageal reflux (GER) which is caused by immaturity of the muscle at the base of the esophagus which controls food passage into the stomach. If this muscle functions improperly, food or formula may reflux back into and up the esophagus into the back of the pharynx. This may trigger a reflex in infants which results in apnea.",,
1363,4,Pediatrics,"A 7 day old breastfed infant born at term has had decreased appetite, irritability, and vomiting for 24 hours. On physical examination, the infant appears listless. Respiratory rate is 40/min; heart rate, 160/min; and blood pressure, 68/38 mm Hg. The skin and sclerae are icteric but no other abnormalities are noted. Laboratory studies reveal: hemoglobin 120 g/L; total bilirubin, 270 umol/L; and direct bilirubin, 135 umol/L. Urinalysis is negative for reducing substances. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ",Bacterial sepsis,Blood group incompatibility,Breast milk jaundice,Hypothyroidism,Intrauterine infection,,1,"Neonatal sepsis is invasive bacterial infection occurring in the 1st 90 days of life. Signs are multiple and include diminished spontaneous activity, less vigorous sucking, apnea, bradycardia, temperature instability, respiratory distress, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal distention, jitteriness, seizures, and jaundice. Diagnosis is clinical, with extensive laboratory testing. Treatment is initially with ampicillin plus either gentamicin or cefotaxime, narrowed to organism-specific drugs as soon as possible.",,
1364,4,Pediatrics,"Each of the following statements about rotavirus gastroenteritis in children is correct, except: ",It usually occurs in the winter months,It is self-limited,It is often associated with respiratory symptoms,It is often accompanied by fever and vomiting,It is often associated with grossly bloody diarrhea,,5,"Rotavirus is a common and contagious virus that causes vomiting and diarrhea. Rotavirus is one of the most common causes of diarrhea in children. Although hardly any children die from rotavirus, worldwide the virus causes over 600,000 deaths a year, mostly in developing countries. Infection is spread mainly by swallowing material contaminated by the virus. Adults can become infected, but serious illness is rare.Symptoms begin with fever and vomiting, followed by watery diarrhea, which typically lasts 5 to 7 days. If fluid losses are not replaced, dehydration develops. Dehydration makes the child weak and listless, with a dry mouth and rapid pulse.",,
1365,4,Pediatrics,A child born at 32 weeks gestation is brought to your office at 2 months of age for a routine check up. The child has an upper respiratory tract infection but is afebrile. What decision would you make regarding the child's today's vaccination? ,Wait until the child is two months older to administer the first vaccination,Wait until the child is clinically well and then vaccinate,Administer the first vaccination,Consult a pediatrician,,,3,"Acute illness is not a contraindication to immunization. At 2 months of age this child should receive the following shots:DTaP: Diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine Hib: Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine IPV: Inactivated poliovirus vaccine PCV: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine RV: Rotavirus vaccine, recommended for infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age",,
1366,4,Pediatrics,The most common cause of hemoptysis in a 6 year old boy is: ,Cystic fibrosis,Pneumonia,Foreign body,Tracheobronchitis,Neoplasm,,3,"Hemoptysis is defined as coughing up of blood or the presence of blood in sputum. It is not a common symptom in children and although not usually life-threatening, it can become so. Because children younger than 6 years of age tend to swallow their sputum, they rarely present with hemoptysis, unless the bleeding is substantial. Foreign body aspiration remains a leading cause of hemoptysis in children, with the majority of cases occurring in those younger than 4 years of age.",,
1367,4,Pediatrics,A 15 month old child has spastic cerebral palsy. Which of the following is most suggestive of perinatal asphyxia as the cause for this condition? ,Evidence of periventricular calcificatons at birth,Microcephaly at birth,Recurrent seizures in the newborn period,Retinopathy of prematurity,Rigidity and spasticity,,3,"The etiology of cerebral palsy is not well understood, and brain lesions are thought to be associated with prenatal, perinatal, or postnatal events of varying causes. Risk factors for cerebral palsy are multifactorial and can include preterm birth, multiple gestation, intrauterine growth restriction, male sex, low Apgar scores, intrauterine infections, maternal thyroid abnormalities, prenatal strokes, birth asphyxia due to seizures, maternal methyl mercury exposure, and maternal iodine deficiency.",,
1368,4,Pediatrics,Which of the following genetic diseases is incorrectly linked with its transmission pattern? ,Duchenne muscular dystrophy = sex-linked recessive,Achondroplasia = autosomal dominant,Cystic fibrosis = autosomal recessive,Hemophilia = sex-linked dominant,,,4,"Hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency), which affects about 80% of hemophilic patients, and hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency) have identical clinical manifestations, screening test abnormalities, and X-linked recessive genetic transmission.",,

Which of the following is the most appropriate step? ",Culture the blood,Interrupt breast feeding,Obtain a reticulocyte count,Obtain blood type and Coombs test,,,4,"The Coombs' test looks for antibodies that act against red blood cells. An abnormal (positive) direct Coombs' test means the patient has antibodies that act against their red blood cells. This may be due to autoimmune hemolytic anemia without another underlying cause, drug-induced hemolytic anemia (many drugs have been associated with this complication) or erythroblastosis fetalis (hemolytic disease of the newborn).",,
1371,4,Pediatrics,"A 6 week old male infant develops recurrent episodes of vomiting with dehydration. Each of the following would be consistent with a diagnosis of congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, except: ",Non-bile stained vomitus after feeding,A metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia,A history of increasing constipation,Good appetite,Visible epigastric peristaltic waves,,2,"Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis can cause almost complete gastric outlet obstruction. Symptoms develop between 2 and 6 weeks of life. Projectile vomiting (without bile) occurs shortly after eating. Until dehydration sets in, the child feeds avidly and otherwise appears well, unlike many of those with vomiting due to systemic illness. Diagnosis is by abdominal ultrasonography showing increased thickness of the pylorus (typically to = 4 mm; normal,  2 mm). The classic electrolyte pattern of an infant with pyloric stenosis is that of hypochloremic, hypokalemic, metabolic alkalosis.Initial treatment is directed at hydration and correcting electrolyte abnormalities. Definitive treatment is a longitudinal pyloromyotomy, which leaves the mucosa intact and separates the incised muscle fibers.",,
1372,4,Pediatrics,A 14 year old boy is concerned about his height. Physical examination reveals Tanner stage II pubic hair and genital development. Height and weight are at the 10th percentile for age. Which of the following is the most accurate statement about his growth? ,He is taller than the average 14 year old girl,He will be taller than his peers by age 16,He has not reached his peak height velocity,He will stop growing by age 17,His adult height will be at the 10th percentile,,3,"The peak height velocity occurs at a mean of 13.5 years in boys and 11.5 years in girls. Since this boy is only in tanner stage II, he still has not reached the peak height yet.",,
1373,4,Pediatrics,"A 10 year old boy with cough, fever and night sweats has a positive skin test for tuberculosis. A chest x-ray reveals minimal hilar adenopathy and a small pulmonary infiltrate. The current recommended treatment is: ",Isoniazid alone,Isoniazid plus rifampin and pyrazinamide,Isoniazid plus rifampin and streptomycin,Rifampin and corticosteroids,Rifampin and ethambutol,,2,"All patients with new, previously untreated TB should receive a 2 month initial phase of treatment followed by a 4 or 7 month continuation phase. Initial-phase therapy is with a combination of antibiotics for the first 2 months which are isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), and pyrazinamide (PZA).",,
1374,4,Pediatrics,"During the newborn period, physical characteristics suggestive of prematurity include each of the following, except: ",A prominent diastasis of the rectus muscles,Scant ear cartilage,Absent breast buds,Thin skin,Hypotonic posture at rest,,1,"The abdomen is constructed of several layers of muscles many of which meet in the mid-line of the body. One of the primary sets of muscles that meet at this middle line are called the rectus muscles. These are the muscles that give the ripple effect of the lower abdomen in body builders. However, in newborn babies, these muscles may not be quite fully developed. In other words, they may not quite meet at this mid-line. This gap between the rectus muscles of each side of the body essentially causes a minor weakness of the abdomen. So, when the abdominal muscles are tightened like when the child cries or sits up from after lying flat, this vertical line made up of where the rectus muscles meet distends slightly outward. This phenomenon is called diastasis recti. This defect is considered normal in infants and almost always goes away by three years of age. And even if it does not completely resolve, it generally causes no difficulty for the child.",,
1375,4,Pediatrics,A 5 year old child is diagnosed as having juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Which of the following is the least likely side effect of therapy with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug? ,Abdominal pain,Lymphadenopathy,Tinnitus,Anemia,Rash,,2,"NSAIDs are associated with a number of side effects. The most common side effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, decreased appetite, rash, dizziness, headache, and drowsiness. NSAIDs may also cause tinnitus and fluid retention, leading to edema. The most serious side effects are kidney failure, liver failure, ulcers and prolonged bleeding after an injury or surgery. Some individuals are allergic to NSAIDs and may develop shortness of breath when an NSAID is administered. People with asthma are at a higher risk for experiencing serious allergic reaction to NSAIDs.",,
1376,4,Pediatrics,Which of the following is a characteristic chest x-ray appearance of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)?,Air bronchograms,Fluid in fissure,Patchy infiltrate,Concentrated Atelectasis,Enlarged heart,,1,"Respiratory distress syndrome is caused by pulmonary surfactant deficiency in the lungs of neonates born at  37 weeks gestation. Risk increases with degree of prematurity. Symptoms and signs include grunting respirations, use of accessory muscles, and nasal flaring appearing soon after birth. Diagnosis is by clinical presentation, including recognition of risk factors; ABGs demonstrating hypoxemia and hypercapnia; and chest x-ray. Chest x-ray shows diffuse (spread out over a large area; not concentrated) atelectasis classically described as having a ground-glass appearance with visible air bronchograms; appearance correlates loosely with clinical severity.",,
1377,4,Pediatrics,An 8 year old boy presents with sudden onset of pain in the distal femur. His parents recall that he was hit with a hockey stick during a street hockey game last week. The most likely diagnosis is: ,Osteomyelitis,Fracture of the distal femur,Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,Septic arthritis,,,1,"Osteomyelitis is inflammation and destruction of bone caused by bacteria, mycobacteria, or fungi. Common symptoms are localized bone pain and tenderness with constitutional symptoms (in acute osteomyelitis) or without constitutional symptoms (in chronic osteomyelitis). Trauma, ischemia, and foreign bodies predispose to osteomyelitis. Patients with acute osteomyelitis of peripheral bones usually experience weight loss, fatigue, fever, and localized warmth, swelling, erythema, and tenderness. Diagnosis is by radiography and cultures. Bony changes are not evident for 14-21 days and initially manifest as periosteal elevation followed by cortical or medullary lucencies. By 28 days, 90% of patients demonstrate some abnormality. The MRI is effective in the early detection and surgical localization of osteomyelitis.Treatment is with antibiotics and sometimes surgery.",,
1378,4,Pediatrics,"The most likely diagnosis in a 3 years old with a abdominal mass, found to be of renal origin, is: ",Renal cell carcinoma,Wilm's tumor,Neuroblastoma,Renal stones,Polycystic kidney disease,,2,"Wilms tumor (WT) is the fifth most common pediatric malignancy and the most common type of renal tumor in children. This neoplasm may present with renal signs and symptoms, such as hypertension, hematuria and abdominal pain. Wilms' tumor should be considered in the differential diagnosis of an abdominal mass in a child. The mean age at diagnosis is 41.5 months for males and 46.9 months for females. Wilms' tumor can present as an abdominal mass in newborns, and it occasionally develops in adolescents.When an abdominal mass is detected in a child, ultrasound examination of the abdomen should be performed within 24 hours by a radiologist with pediatric experience. If the ultrasound examination does not clearly identify the origin of the mass, abdominal CT scanning should be performed. If the mass is confirmed to be of renal origin, immediate referral to a pediatric oncologist and a pediatric surgeon is indicated.Differential Diagnosis of Abdominal Mass in Children--&gt;Neonates-RenalHydronephrosis* Multidysplastic kidney* Mesoblastic nephroma* Renal vein thrombosis&dagger; Polycystic kidney disease&dagger; Wilms' tumor&dagger;Rhabdoid tumor&dagger; -PelvicOvarian cyst Hydrocolpos Hydrometrocolpos Gastrointestinal duplication--&gt;Infants and children -RetroperitonealNeuroblastoma Wilms' tumor Lymphoma-Liver Hepatoblastoma* Embryonal sarcoma&dagger;-Gastrointestinal Duplication Meckel's diverticulum Fecal mass-Pelvic Ovarian cysts Teratomas-Other Omental or mesenteric cyst*Common. &dagger;Rare.

1379,4,Pediatrics,Which of the following congenital anomalies usually resolves spontaneously? ,Club foot,Genu varum,Tibial torsion,Flexible flat feet,Femoral torsion,qe598.jpg,2,"Clinical assessment for Genu varus or bow-leggedness is often made with the legs together by measuring the distance between the knees for bowing and the ankles for knock knee (genu valgum) deformity. A more accurate measurement would be the tibial femoral angle as seen on the standing x-ray. One must be careful that the legs are in neutral rotation when the x-ray is taken, as internal or external rotation will alter this angle. Physiologic bow leg deformity should spontaneously correct by two years of age. No x-rays are usually necessary before then. Internal tibial torsion and external rotation contracture of the hips often accompany genu varum and tend to accentuate the deformity.Treatment is reassurance and observation. Shoe corrections, splints and exercise programs do not produce any change different than the normal expected spontaneous correction.",,
1380,4,Pediatrics,A 5 year old boy develops a rash. He also has Koplik's spots that have appeared. His other symptoms include fever and cough. Which of the following illnesses does he most likely have? ,Measles,Mumps,Rubella,Diptheria,Polio,,1,"Measles is a highly contagious, viral infection that is most common in children. It is characterized by fever, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, enanthem (Koplik's spots) on the buccal or labial mucosa, and a maculopapular rash that spreads cephalocaudally. Diagnosis is usually clinical. Treatment is supportive. Vaccination is highly effective.",,
1381,4,Pediatrics,"A 4 year old boy develops a headache, cough, myalgia and a fever. He has been a healthy child with all immunizations up to date. He is given a decongestant and an aspirin for his symptoms with some relief. However, 3 days later, he is brought back by his parents because of persistent vomiting and irritability. On physical examination, he is found to be semicomatose, becoming combative on stimulation. Which of the following levels should be measured to aid in the diagnosis of this patient?  ",Serum ammonia level,Serum blood urea nitrogen level,Serum calcium level,Serum opiate level,Serum sodium level,,1,"The child is presenting with symptoms of Reye syndrome, which is an acute encephalopathy associated with high ammonia levels. It most commonly occurs in young children after a viral illness. Administration of aspirin increases the risk of developing this disorder. The vomiting is characteristic.",,
1382,4,Pediatrics,"A 5 year old girl presents to the ER with acute onset of muscle weakness. Her muscle weakness started in her legs yesterday. The weakness became worse today and progressed to the trunk and both arms. She was also complaining difficulty of breathing earlier today. She has been otherwise healthy but had a common cold about 10 days ago. On examination, her respirations are 25/min and shallow. She has profound muscle weakness in her lower extremities, and moderate weakness in her upper extremities. Her deep tendon reflexes are absent. A lumbar puncture is performed, which shows increased protein concentration. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  ",Botulism,Dermatomyositis,Guillain-Barr syndrome,Myasthenia gravis,,,3,"The girl in this clinical vignette has classic Guillain-Barr syndrome, also known as acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP). It is an acute illness characterized by rapid demyelination of peripheral nerves. A symmetric ascending weakness progresses rapidly. In this case, the involvement of the respiratory muscles is potentially life threatening. Sensory deficit, involvement of facial musculature, and autonomic insufficiency may occasionally happen. Weakness usually follows a nonspecific viral infection by about 7-14 days. Lumbar puncture shows elevation of protein concentration in the absence of pleocytosis in the CSF. Diagnosis is made by nerve conduction studies, which will show demyelination. Treatment involves plasmapheresis or gamma-globulin infusion. Respiratory failure must be aggressively managed with adequate respiratory support. Children with this syndrome have a very good prognosis; full recovery is usually the rule. A few may be left with some residual weakness.",,
1383,4,Pediatrics,"A 5 year old girl was diagnosed with otitis media about 10 days ago and was prescribed oral amoxicillin. She has since developed bloody diarrhea with mucus, crampy abdominal pain, and fever. On physical examination, her temperature is 39.4 C (102.9 F), pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 16/min. She has normal bowel sounds and is diffusely tender to palpation. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in diagnosis?  ",Barium enema,Evaluation of stool for Clostridium difficile toxins,Evaluation of stool for rotavirus,Stool examination for ova and parasites,Stool Hemoccult test,,2,"The girl in this clinical vignette has pseudomembranous colitis, which is caused by the toxins produced by Clostridium difficile. The colon is colonized by C. difficile after eradication of the normal microflora by a course of antibiotics. Virtually all antibiotics, including metronidazole and vancomycin, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of pseudomembranous colitis. Patients usually present with watery or bloody diarrhea, tenesmus, fever, and abdominal pain. Symptoms typically occur 7-10 days after initiation of the antibiotic; in rare cases, pseudomembranous colitis can occur up to 6 weeks after antibiotic initiation. On sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, the disease is characterized by an accumulation of an inflammatory exudate, the pseudomembrane over the mucosa. Assay for C. difficile toxins is useful in diagnosing pseudomembranous colitis. An alternative is to perform stool cultures for C. difficile. Oral metronidazole is the treatment of choice.",,
1384,4,Pediatrics,A neonate develops severe cyanosis that begins within minutes of birth. Blood drawn one hour after birth shows metabolic acidosis with respiratory acidosis. A chest x-ray film shows a narrow base to the great vessels and the heart resembles an egg on its side. ECG is normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  ,Aortic valve stenosis,Complete atrioventricular canal defect,Tetralogy of Fallot,Transposition of the great arteries,Underdeveloped (hypoplastic) left ventricle syndrome,,4,"This is transposition of the great arteries, in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. Approximately 5% of congenital cardiac anomalies have transposition of the great arteries. Affected babies present within minutes of birth with severe cyanosis and metabolic acidosis secondary to inability to oxygenate tissues. The only exchange of blood between pulmonic and circulatory systems is typically occurring through a patent ductus arteriosus. The chest x-ray changes illustrated in the question stem are typical, and are due to superposition of the great vessels (rather than the normal side-to-side position). Surgical repair is usually performed within 7 to 10 days of life.",,
1385,4,Pediatrics,"A 12 year old boy is brought to the clinic because of a several month history of strange behavior. According to his parents, the boy occasionally will start staring and not respond. He will also have tears in his eyes. These episodes last several seconds and he then returns to his baseline. He has not sustained any head trauma and is on no medications. Which of the following drugs is the most appropriate treatment?  ",Diazepam,Diphenhydramine,Ethosuximide,Phenobarbital,Phenytoin,,3,"The patient is having absence or petit mal seizures, and the drug of choice is ethosuximide or valproic acid. Diazepam is effective in treating status epilepticus but is not used in treating petit mal seizures. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine and would not be of benefit in treating this illness. Phenobarbital and Phenytoin are anticonvulsants, but are not used for absence seizures.",,
1386,4,Pediatrics,"A newborn baby is noted to have abnormal facies with low-set ears, a small receding jaw, and widely separated eyes. At 30 hours of age, the baby develops multiple muscle spasms. Serum studies are notable for calcium of 4.5 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  ",Bruton's agammaglobulinemia,Common variable immunodeficiency,DiGeorge syndrome,Selective IgA deficiency,Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy,,3,"This is DiGeorge syndrome, which is a congenital syndrome in which abnormal development of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches leads to absence or hypoplasia of the thymus and parathyroid glands. The diagnosis is suspected in an infant, often with a malformed face, who develops a difficult-to-manage hypocalcemia, typically at 24 to 48 hours of life. The diagnosis can be confirmed with chest x-ray, which will fail to show the normal thymic shadow. The infants should also be evaluated for congenital cardiovascular disease, as this may be part of the developmental abnormality. Infants that survive the initial hypocalcemia (requiring extremely careful medical management) become vulnerable to recurrent infections shortly after birth. The defect usually involves T cells (with normal or near normal B cell function), and, in some cases, may resolve spontaneously as the child ages and a small remnant of thymus hypertrophies.",,
1387,6,Surgery,"A 10 year old male fell while riding his scooter down a steep hill. In the Emergency Department, his injuries included a fractured wrist and a lacerated spleen, which required surgical removal. Two years later he is diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. Which of the following bacterial agents is the most likely pathogen for this patient's pneumonia?  ",Escherichia coli,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Neisseria meningitidis,Streptococcus pneumoniae,Staphylococcus aureus,,4,"This patient underwent a splenectomy after his injury, and thus is susceptible to encapsulated organisms. S. pneumoniae is the most important pathogen in asplenic children. Less common causes of infection include Hemophilus influenzae type B, E. coli, Staph. aureus, and gram-negative bacilli such as Salmonella, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas. Asplenic children are also at increased risk for fatal malaria and babesiosis. This child should receive a pneumococcal vaccine.",,
1388,4,Pediatrics,At 36 hours of age a full-term infant has not yet passed meconium. Physical examination reveals jaundice and abdominal distention. Radiographs of the abdomen show dilated loops of bowel and calcifications in the scrotum. A meconium plug is passed after rectal examination. Which of the following would be the most definitive diagnostic test to order ,Barium enema,Sweat chloride test,Ultrasound of the abdomen,Urine calcium excretion,Voiding cystourethrogram,,2,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease of the exocrine glands affecting primarily the GI and respiratory systems. It leads to COPD, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and abnormally high sweat electrolytes. Diagnosis is by sweat test or identification of 2 cystic fibrosis mutations in patients with characteristic symptoms. Treatment is supportive through aggressive interdisciplinary care. Meconium ileus due to obstruction of the ileum by viscid meconium may be the earliest sign and is present in 15 to 20% of affected neonates. It is often associated with volvulus, perforation, or atresia and, with rare exceptions, is followed by other CF signs. CF also may be associated with delayed neonatal passage of meconium and with the meconium plug syndrome (a transient form of distal intestinal obstruction secondary to one or more plugs of inspissated meconium in the anus or colon).",,
1389,4,Pediatrics,Organic causes in the differential diagnosis of recurrent abdominal pain include: ,UTI,Lactose intolerance,Chronic giardiasis,Inflammatory bowel disease,All of the above,,5,"Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) is common in children especially in pre-school children and adolescents. Recurrent abdominal pain is an expression of physiological maladjustments in response to family or school problems in predisposed children. Contrary to this belief, many studies have found organic causes of RAP to be more common. The occurrence of nocturnal pain is considered an important indicator of an organic (disease-based). Night pain or pain on awakening suggests a peptic origin, while pain that occurs in the evening or during dinner is a feature of constipation.Organic causes include (but are not limited to) gastrointestinal disease, urinary tract infections, parasite infestation and esophagitis/gastritis.",,

Cow's milk is the most common dietary cause of iron deficiency in infants. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia and usually results from blood loss. Symptoms are usually nonspecific. RBCs tend to be microcytic and hypochromic, and iron stores are low as shown by low serum ferritin and low serum iron with high serum transferrin. If the diagnosis is made, occult blood loss is suspected. Treatment involves iron replacement and treatment of blood loss.",,

On physical examination, he has stable vital signs, clear lungs, normal skin turgor and full fontanelles. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the patient's presentation?  ",Botulism,Hirschsprung disease,Hypernatremia,Hyponatremia,Hypothyroidism,,1,The clue to this patient's condition is the recent of a honey-containing formula. Clostridium botulinum spores that are commonly found in honey germinate in the infant's gastrointestinal tract and produce the characteristic toxin. Infants younger than 1 year of age should not be placed on a diet with honey.,,

1397,5,Psychiatry,Monoamine oxidase inhibitor drugs are used in the treatment of depression because they increase synaptic levels of,Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA),Histamine,Acetylcholine,Norepinephrine,Somatostatin,,4,"Once the brain's three neurotransmitters, known as monoamines (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine), have played their part in sending messages in the brain, they get burned up by a protein in the brain called monoamine oxidase, a liver and brain enzyme.Antidepressants known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors work by blocking this cleanup activity. When the excess neurotransmitters don't get destroyed, they start piling up in the brain. And since depression is associated with low levels of these monoamines, increasing the monoamines ease depressive symptoms.",,

Recently, the patient has been exploring his thoughts and feelings around his wife's complaint that he is too restricted and inhibited in their sexual activity. The patient admits that he wishes to be more sexually available for his wife, but finds himself maintaining a restricted stance. Which of the following defense mechanisms would best describe this patient's tendency in his sexual relationship with his wife?  ",Projection,Reaction formation,Sexualization,Somatization,Sublimation,,2,"Reaction formation, often seen in obsessional characters, is the term for the defense mechanism in which an unacceptable impulse is transformed into its opposite. In this case, during insight-oriented psychotherapy, the patient realizes his wish to be freer in his sexual relationship with his wife (an impulse which he finds unacceptable on some level) but finds himself responding in the opposite way (maintaining a restricted stance). Inhibition may also partly account for this man's difficulty, in that a renunciation is used to evade anxiety arising out of impulses.",,

",Antisocial personality disorder,Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),Conduct disorder,Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD),Tourette syndrome,,3,"This patient has conduct disorder. The diagnosis requires a pattern of behavior that violates societal rules and the basic rights of others. Common features include lying, stealing, running away, staying out without permission, setting fires, truancy, vandalism, cruelty to animals, bullying, physical aggression, and sexual aggression.

Which of the following antidepressants would be the best choice for initial treatment?  ",Bupropion,Fluoxetine,Imipramine,Paroxetine,Sertraline,,1,"Bupropion is the antidepressant of the choices listed that has the fewest adverse sexual side effects. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine, paroxetine , and sertraline are all known to be associated with erectile and orgasmic disturbances, such as delayed ejaculation and anorgasmia.

",Body dysmorphic disorder,Conversion disorder,Munchausen syndrome,Pain disorder,Somatization disorder,,2,"This case illustrates conversion disorder. In this condition, physical symptoms are caused by psychological conflict. The symptoms develop unconsciously and are, by definition, limited to those that mimic a neurologic disorder, such as impaired coordination, weakness, paralysis, loss of sensation, blindness, deafness, or inability to speak.

Based on this information, the most likely diagnosis of the woman's problem is ",Anorexia nervosa,Cocaine withdrawal,Paranoid personality,Psychostimulant abuse,Shared paranoid disorder,,4,"In toxic doses, the psychostimulants begin to produce unpleasant CNS symptoms including anxiety, agitation, hallucinations, delirium, seizures, and death. High-dose, long-term use of stimulants can induce an acute psychotic state in previously healthy individuals. CNS-induced abnormalities, seizures, or muscular hyperactivity may induce hyperthermia. secondary rhabdomyolysis may also be seen. Cardiovascular manifestations include hypertension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, and myocardial ischemia. Cerebrovascular accidents are precipitated by elevated blood pressure or drug-induced vasospasms.The clinical picture of stimulant intoxication also includes a wide array of psychiatric symptoms including schizophrenic symptoms, manic-like states, psychoses, depressions (especially during withdrawal), and various types of anxiety conditions including panic states. Psychotic symptoms usually arise with chronic abuse but may also appear acutely with large doses of stimulants. With high doses of stimulants, symptoms of extreme anger in conjunction with aggressive behavior can also be a catalyst for both violence and murder and is especially seen in cases of methamphetamine and cocaine intoxication.",,

These side effects are mostly present during the initial 1-4 weeks while the body adapts to the drug. It is well documented that SSRIs can cause various sexual dysfunctions such as anorgasmia (inability to reach orgasm), diminished libido (sex drive) and erectile dysfunction or difficult/premature ejaculation in men. Such side effects have been found present in between 41% and 83% of patients responding to physician inquiry. These side effects occasionally disappear spontaneously without discontinuing use of the drug, and in most cases resolve themselves after stopping taking the SSRI.",,
1414,5,Psychiatry,Which of the following is correct about depression in children,Family therapy should be avoided because it scapegoats a child who is already vulnerable,Symptoms may manifest as antisocial behaviour,Antidepressants generally are not effective in children,The suicide rate in children aged 8-13 is higher than it is in older adolescents,Depression in children has been shown to be a prodrome to the later development of schizophrenia,,2,"Depression among children and adolescents is common but frequently unrecognized. It affects 2 percent of prepubertal children and 5 to 8 percent of adolescents. The clinical spectrum of the disease can range from simple sadness to a major depressive, bipolar disorder or antisocial disorder. Risk factors include a family history of depression and poor school performance. Evaluation should include a complete medical assessment to rule out underlying medical causes. A structured clinical interview and various rating scales such as the Pediatric Symptom Checklist are helpful in determining whether a child or adolescent is depressed. Psychotherapy appears to be useful in most children and adolescents with mild to moderate depression. Tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are medical therapies that have been studied on a limited basis. The latter agents are better tolerated but not necessarily more efficacious. Because the risk of school failure and suicide is quite high in depressed children and adolescents, prompt referral or close collaboration with a mental health professional is often necessary.",,

He has told another engineer that he is involved in a research project that will earn me the Nobel Prize. The engineer is irritable, and it is hard to hold his attention. A classmate from graduate school recalls that the patient behaved in a similar manner twice during stressful periods at school. Long term drug therapy for this patient would likely include ",Lithium,Clozapine,Ascorbic acid,Chlordiazepoxide,,,1,"Mania is descibed by the following:1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity,2. Decreased need for sleep,3. Excessive talking,4. Racing thoughts,5. Distractibility,6. Increased goal-directed activity,7. Excessive involvement in pleasurable activities with potentially painful consequences, such as sexual indiscretions or spending sprees.Mania and hypomania usually develop before the patient reaches age 40, unless the patient has had prior depressive episodes. The differential diagnosis of new-onset mania in a younger person should include drug-induced mental disorders and brief reactive psychosis. If thought disorder is prominent, a primary thought disorder in the schizophrenic spectrum must be considered. If the patient is confused or disoriented, agitated delirium is a relevant consideration.The primary treatment for mania or hypomania is therapy with a mood-stabilizing drug, of which lithium was the first and is the best-studied. Patients who do not respond to lithium, those with rapid cycles between depression and mania, and those with a mixture of manic and depressive symptoms may respond well to a mood-stabilizing antiepileptic drug. These drugs are given at typical antiepileptic dosages. The effects of valproate and carbamazepine are well-established by clinical trials; gabapentin has shown mood-stabilizing effects when used as an anticonvulsant and may eventually be used as a psychiatric drug. Functionally impaired patients with prominent paranoid features, and those who fail to respond to both lithium and antiepileptic drugs, should be treated with neuroleptics.[Internal Medicine, Stein - 5th Ed.

The severe morbidity and mortality associated with these drugs is well documented and due to their cardiovascular and neurological toxicity. Additionally, they are a serious problem in the pediatric population due to their inherent toxicity and the availability of these in the home when prescribed for bed wetting and depression.The central nervous system and heart are the two main systems that are affected. Initial or mild symptoms include drowsiness, a dry mouth, nausea, and vomiting. More severe complications, include hypotension, cardiac rhythm disturbances, hallucinations, and seizures. Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities are frequent and a wide variety of cardiac dysrhythmias can occur, the most common being sinus tachycardia and intraventricular conduction delay (QRS prolongation). Seizures and cardiac dysrhythmias are the most important life threatening complications.",,

Other predisposing factors include a history of suicide in family members or close friends, a recent death in the family, substance abuse, and conduct disorder. More immediate precipitating factors can include loss of self-esteem (eg, resulting from family arguments, a humiliating disciplinary episode, pregnancy, school failure); loss of a boyfriend or girlfriend; and loss of familiar surroundings (eg, school, neighborhood, friends) due to a geographic move.Other factors may be a lack of structure and boundaries, leading to an overwhelming feeling of lack of direction, or intense parental pressure to succeed accompanied by the feeling of falling short of expectations. A frequent motive for a suicide attempt is the effort to manipulate or punish others with the fantasy You will be sorry after I am dead. A rise in suicides is seen after a well-publicized suicide (eg, of a rock star) and among self-identified populations (eg, a high school, a college dormitory), indicating the power of suggestion.",,

Symptoms must include sadness deep enough to be described as despondency or despair (often called depressed mood) or loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities (anhedonia). Other mental symptoms include feelings of worthlessness or guilt, recurrent thoughts of death or suicide, reduced ability to concentrate, and occasionally agitation. Physical symptoms include changes in weight or appetite, loss of energy, fatigue, psychomotor retardation or agitation, and sleep disorders (insomnia, hypersomnia, early morning awakening).

SGAs tend to alleviate positive symptoms; may lessen negative symptoms to a greater extent than do conventional antipsychotics (although such differences have been questioned); may cause less cognitive blunting; are less likely to cause extrapyramidal (motor) adverse effects; have a lower risk of causing tardive dyskinesia; and for some SGAs produce little or no elevation of prolactin.Clozapine is the only SGA demonstrated to be effective in up to 50% of patients resistant to conventional antipsychotics. Clozapine reduces negative symptoms, produces few or no motor adverse effects, and has minimal risk of causing tardive dyskinesia, but it produces other adverse effects, including sedation, hypotension, tachycardia, weight gain, type 2 diabetes, and increased salivation. It also may cause seizures in a dose-dependent fashion. The most serious adverse effect is agranulocytosis, which can occur in about 1% of patients. Consequently, frequent monitoring of WBCs is required, and clozapine is generally reserved for patients who have responded inadequately to other drugs.",,

Inattention and impulsivity impede development of academic skills and thinking and reasoning strategies, motivation for school, and adjustment to social demands. Children who have predominantly inattentive ADHD tend to be hands-on learners who have difficulty in passive-learning situations that require continuous performance and task completion. Overall, about 30% of children with ADHD have learning disabilities.Behavioral history can reveal low frustration tolerance, opposition, temper tantrums, aggressiveness, poor social skills and peer relationships, sleep disturbances, anxiety, dysphoria, depression, and mood swings.",,

When feeling cared for, they appear like lonely waifs who seek help for depression, substance abuse, eating disorders, and past mistreatments. When they fear the loss of the caring person, they frequently express inappropriate and intense anger. These mood shifts are typically accompanied by extreme changes in their view of the world, themselves, and other peopleeg, from bad to good, from hated to loved.

Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment is with cognitive-behavioral therapy; olanzapine may help with weight gain, and SSRIs, especially fluoxetine, may help prevent relapse. Bulimia nervosa is recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by self-induced vomiting, laxative or diuretic abuse, vigorous exercise, or fasting. Diagnosis is based on history and examination. Treatment is with psychotherapy and SSRIs, especially fluoxetine.In anorexia, the illness begins between early adolescence (13-18 y) and early adulthood, earlier-onset and later-onset are encountered.

Symptoms are usually acute, dramatic, and convincing and are accompanied by a tendency to wander from one physician or hospital to another for treatment. The exact cause is unknown, although stress and borderline personality disorder are often implicated.Munchausen syndrome is distinguished from other factitious diseases by the lack of secondary gain. The patient's reason for engaging in deception is not to escape some consequence in life.

This is an example of ,Graded exposure,Participant modelling,Positive reinforcement,Flooding,Relationship therapy,,4,"Flooding is a psychotherapeutic technique used to help patients heal their traumatic memories. It works by exposing the patient to their painful memories, with the goal of reintegrating their repressed emotions with their current awareness.'Flooding' is an effective form of treatment for phobias amongst other psychopathologies. It works on the behaviourist principles of classical conditioning. According to classical conditioning we learn through associations so if we have a phobia it is because we associate the feared object or stimulus with something negative.If we were using flooding to treat a phobia we would expose a person to vast amounts of the feared stimulus. Example, if a person was scared of spiders we might lock them in a room full of spiders. The idea is that whilst a person will be initially very anxious, the body cannot stay anxious forever. When nothing bad happens the person will begin to calm down and so from that moment on associate a feeling of calm with the previously feared object.",,

The general approach, developed out of behavior modification, CBT has become widely used to treat various kinds of neurosis and psychopathology, including mood disorders and anxiety disorders. The particular therapeutic techniques vary according to the particular kind of client or issue, but commonly include keeping a diary of significant events and associated feelings, thoughts and behaviors; questioning and testing cognitions, assumptions, evaluations and beliefs that might be unhelpful and unrealistic; gradually facing activities which may have been avoided; and trying out new ways of behaving and reacting. Relaxation and distraction techniques are also commonly included. CBT is widely accepted as an evidence- and empiricism-based, cost-effective psychotherapy for many disorders and psychological problems. In recent years, CBT has been used to treat symptoms of schizophrenia, such as delusions and hallucinations.An intensive form of cognitive-behavioral therapy that requires patients to imagine themselves being exposed to the traumatic event is highly effective for rape-related PTSD.This technique produces significant reduction in all symptom clusters of the disorder in most patients.",,

Although the frequency of suicides for young adults has been increasing in recent years, elderly Caucasian males continue to have the highest suicide rate. Other risk factors for taking one's life include single marital status, unemployment, low income, mental illness, a history of being physically or sexually abused, a personal history of suicidal thoughts, threats or behaviors, or a family history of attempting suicide.Data regarding mental illnesses as risk factors indicate that depression, manic depression, schizophrenia, substance abuse, eating disorders, and severe anxiety increase the probability of suicide attempts and completions. Nine out of 10 people who commit suicide have a diagnosable mental illness and up to three out of four individuals who take their own life had a physical illness when they committed suicide. Behaviors that tend to be linked with suicide attempts and completions include violence against others and self-mutilation, like slitting one's wrists or other body parts, or burning oneself.",,

If at all possible, voluntary hospitalization is always better. However, often the reasoning ability of a mentally ill person in crisis is impaired, and it is not always possible to convince him of the need for inpatient treatment. Consequently, a person may be seriously ill, but if he refuses treatment, he cannot be committed to a hospital against his will unless he meets all of the following criteria:He/she must have a mental illness, his/her behavior and actions must be driven by or be a consequence of this mental illness, because of his/her behavior, there must be a reasonable expectation that serious physical harm to self or others will occur in the near future.Also one of the following three conditions must be present:There is an imminent threat that the person will harm himself or herself, there is an imminent threat that the person will cause serious physical harm to someone else, or the person is not able to provide for his or her basic physical needs so as to guard against serious harm.",,

His wife reports that he had been drinking heavily in response to marital problems and had never had such pain before. Appendicitis was diagnosed and an appendectomy was successfully performed. Four days later the patient was anxious, restless, unable to sleep and claimed his wife was a stranger trying to harass him. The most likely diagnosis is ",Paranoid reaction,Delirium tremens,Mania,Schizophreniform reaction,Post-operative delerium,,2,"Delirium tremens (DTs), a very serious set of symptoms, may result if alcohol withdrawal is left untreated. Delirium tremens usually does not begin immediately; rather, it appears about 2 to 10 days after the drinking stops. In delirium tremens, the person is initially anxious and later develops increasing confusion, sleeplessness, nightmares, excessive sweating, and profound depression. The pulse rate tends to speed up. Fever typically develops. The episode may escalate to include fleeting hallucinations, illusions that arouse fear and restlessness, and disorientation with visual hallucinations that may incite terror. Objects seen in dim light may be particularly terrifying, and the person becomes extremely confused. The floor may seem to move, the walls fall, or the room rotates. As the delirium progresses, the hands develop a persistent tremor that sometimes extends to the head and body, and most people become severely uncoordinated. Delirium tremens can be fatal, particularly when untreated.",,
1432,5,Psychiatry,Which of the following symptoms of schizophrenia responds best to anti-psychotic medication? ,Anti-social behavior,Flat affect,Paranoid delusions,Lack of motivation,,,3,"In schizophrenia symptoms are categorized as positive or negative. Positive symptoms are characterized by an excess or distortion of normal functions; negative symptoms, by diminution or loss of normal functions. Positive symptoms can be further categorized as delusions and hallucinations or thought disorder and bizarre behavior. Negative symptoms include blunted affect, poverty of speech, anhedonia, and asociality.Antipsychotic drugs can be effective in reducing or eliminating positive symptoms, such as delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thinking. After the immediate symptoms have cleared, the continued use of antipsychotic drugs substantially reduces the probability of future episodes.",,

You would next ",Reassure her that antidepressants take 5-6 weeks to be effective,Begin intensive psychotherapy,Switch to a different SSRI,Increase the dose to 40 mg, Add a TCA to current management,,4,"Depressive disorders are characterized by sadness severe enough or persistent enough to interfere with function and sometimes by decreased interest or pleasure in activities. Treatment usually consists of drugs, psychotherapy, or both, and sometimes electroconvulsive therapy. Some people respond to antidepressant medication after about two weeks, but for most, the full effect is not seen until four to six weeks or longer. During the first few weeks, the dose is usually increased gradually.By six to eight weeks after starting an antidepressant medication, it is usually possible to determine if the medication is effective. If the symptoms have improved somewhat during this time, the dose of the medication may be increased, or a second medication may be started. If there has been no improvement in symptoms, an alternate antidepressant medication may be recommended.Celexa should be administered at an initial dose of 20 mg once daily, generally with an increase to a dose of 40 mg/day. Dose increases should usually occur in increments of 20 mg at intervals of no less than one week. Although certain patients may require a dose of 60 mg/day, the only study pertinent to dose response for effectiveness did not demonstrate an advantage for the 60 mg/day dose over the 40 mg/day dose; doses above 40 mg are therefore not ordinarily recommended.

People with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders are especially vulnerable to developing TDs after exposure to conventional neuroleptics, anticholinergics, toxins, substances of abuse, and other agents. TDs are most common in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder who have been treated with antipsychotic medication for long periods, but TDs occasionally occur in other patients as well.Tardive dyskinesia may persist after withdrawal of the drug for months, years or even permanently.TDs may be differentiated from acute movement disorders that commonly occur in the same patient groups. The acute movement disorders that occur as manifestations of effects of neuroleptics and other dopamine antagonists include akathisia, acute dystonia, and other hyperkinetic dyskinesias. Acute effects of dopamine antagonists also include Parkinsonian syndromes manifested by bradykinesia, rigidity, and pill rolling tremor. The acute movement disorders resulting from exposure to dopamine antagonists are commonly termed extrapyramidal syndromes (EPS). ",,

Conversion disorder, once referred to as hysteria, is caused by psychologic stress and conflict, which people with this disorder unconsciously convert into physical symptoms. Although conversion disorder tends to occur during adolescence or early adulthood, it may first appear at any age. The disorder is generally believed to be somewhat more common in women than in men.The symptoms of conversion disorder are limited to those that suggest a nervous system dysfunction, usually paralysis of an arm or leg or loss of sensation in a part of the body. Other symptoms may include simulated seizures and the loss of one of the special senses, such as vision or hearing.Generally, the onset of symptoms is linked to some distressing social or psychologic event. A person may have only a single episode in his lifetime or sporadic episodes, but usually the episodes are brief. If people with conversion symptoms are hospitalized, they generally improve within 2 weeks. However, 20 to 25% of those people who are hospitalized have recurrences within a year, and for some people, symptoms become chronic.",,

Objects seen in dim light may be particularly terrifying, and the person becomes extremely confused. The floor may seem to move, the walls fall, or the room rotates. Other problems are directly related to the toxic effects of alcohol on the brain and liver. Prolonged use of excessive amounts of alcohol can lead to alcoholic liver disease. An alcohol-damaged liver is less able to rid the body of toxic substances, which can cause hepatic coma. A person developing hepatic coma becomes dull, sleepy, stuporous, and confused and usually develops an odd flapping tremor of the hands. Hepatic coma is life threatening and needs to be treated immediately.",,

His past medical history is significant for diverticulosis, prior smoking, and hypertension. He says that he has run out of his blood pressure medication. He denies trauma to his back and otherwise feels well. On physical examination his blood pressure is 170/93 mm Hg with a pulse of 88/min. He has no tenderness over the spinal processes or paraspinal areas. His abdomen is obese but there is a suggestion of a non-tender, pulsatile mass in the epigastric region. The remainder of the physical examination is normal. Which of the following diagnoses should be considered at this time?  ",Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA),Acute aortic dissection,Cauda equina syndrome,Lumbosacral disk herniation,Pancreatitis,,1,"It is imperative to recognize the potential presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The combination of the history of hypertension and smoking, the new back pain, and a pulsatile mass on examination is highly suggestive for abdominal aneurysm. The back pain occurs as the expanding mass compresses structures in the retroperitoneum. It is particularly important to make the diagnosis because large aneurysms (greater than 5 cm in diameter) are associated with a very high risk of rupture and subsequent mortality.",,
1440,1,Medicine,"A 55 year old man complains of extremely severe, sharp, shooting pain in his face. He describes the episodes as being like a bolt of electricity that are brought about by touching a specific area, last about 60 seconds, and occur many times during the day. Neurologic examination is completely normal, but it is noted that part of his face is unshaven because he fears to touch that area. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI shows no abnormalities of the trigeminal nerve. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment?  ",Anticonvulsants,Aspirin,Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,Vasoconstrictors,Vasodilators,,1,"The clinical description is that of trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux), which is treated with anticonvulsants. Carbamazepine is usually the first choice, but phenytoin has also been used. Antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, have also been tried.

",Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies,Anti-mitochondrial antibodies,Anti-neutrophilic antibodies,Anti-parietal cell antibodies,Anti-smooth muscle antibodies,,1,"The combination of hematuria and hemoptysis should always raise the possibility of Goodpasture syndrome. Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies are pathognomonic for this diagnosis. Anti-mitochondrial antibodies are found in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. The anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies are found in patients with Wegener granulomatosis. Wegener granulomatosis may also present with pulmonary and renal involvement but will have associated upper respiratory tract findings, e.g, sinusitis and sinus abscesses. Anti-parietal cell antibodies are found in patients with the autoimmune disease known as pernicious anemia. Anti-smooth muscle antibodies are found in patients with autoimmune hepatitis.",,

Which of the following medications is most likely contributing to his wheezing?  ",Enalapril,Hydrochlorothiazide,Propranolol,Pseudoephedrine,Ranitidine,,3,"Propranolol, like other nonspecific beta blockers, may cause bronchospasm by blocking the beta receptors in the bronchial tree. Beta stimulation in the lungs produces bronchodilation, and its blockade leads to bronchoconstriction. In fact, propranolol is contraindicated in patients with known asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).",,

Akathisia (motor restlessness) is particularly unpleasant and may lead to noncompliance. These drugs may also cause tardive dyskinesia, an involuntary movement disorder most often characterized by puckering of the lips and tongue and/or writhing of the arms or legs. The incidence of tardive dyskinesia is about 5%/year of drug exposure among patients taking conventional antipsychotics. In about 2%, tardive dyskinesia is severely disfiguring. In some patients, tardive dyskinesia persists indefinitely, even after the drug is stopped.",,

",Embolization from aortic sclerosis,Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia,Paradoxical embolus,Hypercoagulable state from immobilization,Vasospasm of the brachial artery,,2,"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is the result of platelet aggregation caused by heparin-induced antibodies. It is seen in 1% to 5% of patients on heparin. Therapy is discontinuation of the heparin and use of another anticoagulant, such as lepirudin. When the platelet count falls below 50,000/mm3 the heparin should be stopped. HIT can lead to limb-threatening thromboses, as in this patient, and constitutes a medical emergency. Arterial thrombosis is a manifestation of the HIT syndrome.",,

Lithium may precipitate hypothyroidism, particularly when there is a family history of hypothyroidism. Therefore, TSH levels should be monitored when lithium is started and at least annually if there is a family history or if symptoms suggest thyroid dysfunction or at least biannually for all other patients.Patients with a history of parenchymal renal disease may be at risk of structural damage to the distal tubule.

He has labored breathing and is cyanotic, diaphoretic, cold, and shivering. He is wide awake, and in a normal tone of voice he tells everyone that he is going to die. An initial survey reveals a blood pressure of 60/40 mm Hg. His pulse is 150/min and barely perceptible. He is in obvious respiratory distress and has big distended veins in his neck and forehead. His trachea is deviated to the left, and the right side of his chest is hyperresonant to percussion, with no breath sounds. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?  ",Emergency blood gases,Immediate chest x-ray films,Awake endotracheal intubation,A 16-gauge needle inserted in the second right intercostal space,Pericardiocentesis,,4,"This patient obviously has a tension pneumothorax on the right. The pressure needs to be relieved immediately, which insertion of a needle will do. Then, a formal chest tube should be inserted. Blood gases or chest x-ray films are not needed to recognize the presence of a tension pneumothorax. These two studies will soon be done in this patient, but not before action is taken to save his life by prompt decompression of the tension pneumothorax. A patient who is awake and alert and speaking with a normal tone of voice has a patent airway. At this moment, he does not need endotracheal intubation, although given his multiple injuries, he will probably end up having surgery and being intubated for that anesthetic.",,

He has been less than totally compliant with medical management, which he follows when the pain is bad, but discontinues when he feels better. Endoscopy and biopsies show severe peptic esophagitis, with Barrett's esophagus and early dysplastic changes, but no overt carcinoma. Additional tests show good esophageal motility, with low pressure in the lower esophageal sphincter and normal gastric emptying. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment at this time?  ",Heller myotomy of the lower esophageal sphincter,Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication,Transhiatal total esophagectomy,Transthoracic resection of the lower esophagus,,,2,"This man has indications for surgical intervention, but all he needs is an antireflux operation. By far the most commonly used procedure is a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Heller myotomy is used for achalasia. Here it would do the exact opposite of what is needed. Transhiatal total esophagectomy is the most commonly used operation for esophageal cancer. It is only palliative, since it cannot provide a true &quot;cancer operation&quot; with wide dissection, but esophageal cancer is rarely amenable to true curative resection when it becomes symptomatic. Although this man could develop cancer if he is not treated, he does not have advanced cancer at this time.",,

She had an indwelling bladder catheter during the procedure, which was removed in the recovery room. On the evening of the 3rd postoperative day, she spikes a fever, with a temperature to 39.4 C (103 F). Which of the following is the most likely source of the fever?  ",Atelectasis,Deep thrombophlebitis,Intra-abdominal abscess,Urinary tract infection,Wound infection,,4,"The timing is our major clue. Fever on postoperative day 3 is usually from the urinary tract. The circumstances are also there: she had instrumentation of her urinary tract during the procedure. Atelectasis is usually seen on day 1, and she is doing everything possible to avoid this complication. Deep thrombophlebitis could show up this early, but is more likely to do so 5-7 days after surgery. Furthermore, the patient had adequate protection during surgery and has been moving around since early on. Intra-abdominal abscess would need at least 7-10 days to develop. This is too early for that. Wound infection is likewise a later complication, typically seen about a week after the operation.",,

The pain is worse in the mornings, preventing him from putting any weight on the heel. X-ray films show a bony spur matching the location of his pain, and physical examination shows exquisite tenderness to direct palpation right over that heel spur. Furthermore, when the ankle is dorsiflexed, the entire inner border of the fascia is tender to palpation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  ",Epiphysitis of the calcaneus,Fracture of the posterolateral talar tubercle,Plantar fasciitis,Posterior Achilles tendon bursitis,Posterior tibial nerve neuralgia,,3,"All the details are in the vignette, including the association with a heel spur that in the past led many of these patients to undergo unnecessary surgery to remove the spur. The spur is caused by the pull of the fascia and is not the cause of the plantar fasciitis. Epiphysitis of the calcaneus affects children, and the pain occurs along the sides of the heel where the heel growth centers are located.",,

In some men, the blood vessels narrow and don't allow the increased blood flow needed for a full erection. Conditions that cause the blood vessels to narrow include atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and long-term smoking.During a normal erection, signals from the brain and spinal cord are sent through nerves to the blood vessels in the pelvis and the genitals. These signals cause the blood vessels to widen and allow the penis to fill with blood and become erect. Many conditions can interfere with these signals, causing erectile dysfunction. Damage to the nerves may be caused by stroke or spinal cord injury, or may occur during prostate surgery or other types of surgery. Diabetes and long-term heavy alcohol use can also damage the nerves' ability to send signals.",,

A bone scan shows increased uptake around the metaphysis of the left femur. Which of the following is the most likely pathogen?  ",Escherichia coli,Haemophilus influenzae,Salmonella,Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus pneumoniae,,4,"Osteomyelitis is a pyogenic infection of the bone. The pathogenesis of the disease is similar to septic arthritis, with the origin of infection occurring from hematogenous spread, direct extension of a local infection, or direct inoculation of bone either from trauma (e. g. , puncture wound or open fracture) or surgical manipulation. In children, the most frequent presentation is acute hematogenous spread. The most common location of osteomyelitis is the metaphysis of the distal femur and proximal tibia. The most prevalent pathogens are the same as those seen in septic arthritis. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen, with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci a distant second. Neonates are at risk for group B beta-hemolytic streptococci. Patients with sickle cell disease are at risk for infection by Salmonella and other gram-negative bacteria, and patients in the 18- to 48-month age range are at increased risk for acute recurrent Salmonella osteomyelitis.

The most common symptom of peripheral vascular disease is intermittent claudication. At other times, peripheral vascular disease leads to acute or critical limb ischemia. Intermittent claudication manifests as pain in the muscles of the legs with exercise, it is experienced by 2 percent of persons older than 65 years. Physical findings include abnormal pedal pulses, femoral artery bruit, delayed venous filling time, cool skin, and abnormal skin color. Most patients present with subtle findings and lack classic symptoms, which makes the diagnosis difficult. The standard office-based test to determine the presence of peripheral vascular disease is calculation of the ankle-brachial index. Treatment is divided into lifestyle, medical, and surgical therapies. Lifestyle therapies focus on exercise, smoking cessation, and dietary modification. Medical therapy is directed at reducing platelet aggregation.

Femoral neck or subcapital hip fractures occur in the neck of the femur. Intertrochanteric fractures occur in the large bony bumps (trochanters) where the powerful muscles of the buttocks and legs attach. When the fracture is not too severe, metal pins can be inserted surgically to support the femoral head. This surgical procedure preserves the person's own hip joint.Most people with a hip fracture are treated with surgery. The type of surgery depends on the type of fracture. Treatment of severe femoral neck hip fractures involves removing the broken pieces surgically because the blood supply to the femoral head has been damaged. If damage to the femoral neck is incomplete (the break does not go all the way through), metal pins can be inserted surgically to support the femoral head (internal fixation). This is a smaller surgical procedure and the person's own hip joint is preserved.Intertrochanteric hip fractures are treated with an implant, such as a sliding compression screw and side plate. This implant securely holds the bone fragments in their proper position while the fracture heals. The fixation is usually strong enough to permit the person to bear weight as tolerated.

Incorporation of HBV DNA into the host's genome may initiate malignant transformation, even in the absence of chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis.Other disorders that cause hepatocellular carcinoma include cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, hemochromatosis, and alcoholic cirrhosis. Patients with cirrhosis due to other conditions are also at increased risk.Environmental carcinogens may play a role; eg, ingestion of food contaminated with fungal aflatoxins is believed to contribute to the high incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in subtropical regions. Diagnosis is based on &alpha;-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, imaging tests, and sometimes liver biopsy.",,
1496,1,Medicine,Which of the following is associated with biliary colic? ,Epigastric pain,Rebound tenderness,Jaundice,Murphy sign,,,1,"About one third of patients with gallstones develop biliary colic or other complications. Colic pain is precipitated by spasm of a dilated cystic duct that is obstructed by gallstones. Attacks of biliary colic are more common at night, possibly because the gallbladder shifts to a horizontal position, facilitating the entry of stones into the cystic duct. Biliary colic is characterized by the sudden onset of intense right upper abdominal pain that may radiate to the shoulder. Sweating and vomiting are common. The pain tends to be steady and lasts up to three hours. Residual abdominal tenderness may occur.Murphy sign, which is inspiratory arrest with palpation of right upper quadrant is seen in cholecystitis.",,
1497,6,Surgery,Which of the following is not a surgically correctable cause of hypertension?,Aortic coarctation,Renal artery stenosis,Pheochromocytoma,Essential hypertension,,,4,"Coarctation of the aorta is localized narrowing of the aortic lumen that results in upper-extremity hypertension. Treatment is balloon angioplasty with stent placement, or surgical correction.Renal artery occlusion is acute or chronic interruption of blood flow through one or both of the main renal arteries or its branches, usually due to thromboemboli, atherosclerosis, or fibromuscular dysplasia. Chronic, progressive occlusion causes refractory hypertension and may lead to chronic renal failure. Treatment of chronic, progressive occlusion includes angioplasty with stenting, surgical bypass, and removal of an infarcted kidney.A pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-secreting tumor of chromaffin cells typically located in the adrenals. It causes persistent or paroxysmal hypertension. Treatment involves surgical removal of the tumor when possible.Essential hypertension, which comprises 90-95% of all cases of hypertension occurs through no secondary cause. It is treated with lifestyle modifications, diet, exercise and medications.",,

1499,1,Medicine,Which of the following is least likely to cause avascular necrosis? ,Sickle cell disease,Hip dislocation,Steroid use,Constrictive dressings,Post-traumatic fracture,,4,"Avascular necrosis (AVN) is focal bone infarction, which may be secondary to various conditions or idiopathic. Severe osteoarthritis can result. Symptoms include bone or joint pain. Early diagnosis is best made by MRI. AVN involves ischemic death of osteocytes and other bone marrow components, producing subchondral bone infarction. Of the many conditions associated with AVN, some are more clearly causative.Posttraumatic AVN develops when blood supply is impaired. Susceptible bone is usually intra-articular and has a limited attachment of soft tissue and accompanying vasculature. The hips, shoulders, body of the talus, and carpal scaphoid are commonly affected.Causes of avascular necrosis include alcohol abuse, coagulation disorders, corticosteroids (high dose), decompression sickness, fatty liver, fracture of the femoral neck, hip dislocation and sickle cell disease.",,

Indications for ORIF treatment of an ankle fracture include all of the following, except ",Fracture is displaced,Unsuccessful closed reduction,Need for mobility,Unstable talar tilt,,,4,"Closed reduction (without skin incision) is done when possible; if not, open reduction (with skin incision) is done.In open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), fracture fragments are aligned and held in place using hardware. ORIF is usually indicated for the following:When an intra-articular fracture is displaced (to precisely align the joint cartilage). When ORIF has been shown to have better results for a particular type of fracture.When closed reduction was ineffective.When the fracture traverses a cancerous lesion (because normal bone healing does not occur). When prolonged immobility (required for callus formation and remodeling) is undesirable (eg, for hip fractures), because ORIF provides early structural stability, which facilitates mobilization.",,
1501,6,Surgery,Which of the following is not an indication for repair of an orbital blow-out fracture?,Enopthalmos,Persistent diplopia,Positive forced duction test,Orbital floor lesion  0.7 cm,Other upper facial fractures,,4,"Sometimes the eye is struck in such a way that the force of the blow is received by the eyeball and not blocked by the strong bones around the eye (as when struck by a small object such as a golf ball). In this case, the pressure on the eyeball is transmitted to the walls of the orbit. This pressure can fracture the most fragile part of the orbit, which is typically the part underneath the eyeball (orbital floor). This is known as a blowout fracture. Fractures can also occur to the sides (walls) and roof of the orbit. Sometimes part of the eye or the muscles attached to it are forced through the fractured bone.Blowout fractures sometimes cause double vision, a sunken eyeball, an eyeball that is stuck looking downward, a decreased sensitivity to touch and pain around the cheek and upper lip (caused by injury to the nerves below the orbit), or an accumulation of air in the tissues under the skin (subcutaneous emphysema). Nosebleeds, swelling of the eyelid, and the passage of blood from ruptured blood vessels into tissue under the skin (marked by a purple discoloration of the skin) may also occur.A doctor who suspects an orbital fracture performs a computed tomography (CT) scan, which shows any fractures, collections of blood, and displaced or trapped tissue. Surgical repair of the facial bones is usually necessary if a blowout fracture traps muscles or soft tissues of the orbit and causes double vision or nerve injury or makes the eyeball sunken or if symptoms do not go away in 2 weeks.",,

In men  35 yr, most cases are due to gram-negative coliform bacilli and typically occur in patients with urologic abnormalities, indwelling catheters, or recent urologic procedures.  ",,
1504,1,Medicine,Which is following statement about PSA is true? ,Every man past the age of 50 should have an annual PSA test as a primary screen for prostate cancer,PSA is best used to follow disease progression or recurrence post-operatively,PSA is a useless test,Increased complex PSA to total PSA ratio favors BPH over prostate cancer,,,2,"Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), is a substance that is usually elevated in men with prostate cancer. PSA levels can be misleading: they can be normal when prostate cancer is present or elevated when prostate cancer is absent. PSA levels normally increase with age, but cancer increases the age-related change. Also, PSA levels can be slightly elevated in men with disorders other than prostate cancer (such as BPH or prostatitis) and in men who have undergone procedures involving the urinary tract within the previous 2 days.That is why a PSA level is not the best screening test, but is best used to follow disease progression or recurrence post-operatively.",,

1507,6,Surgery,"Factors which contribute to the development of squamous cell cancers of the head and neck include all of the following, except ",Cigarette smoking,Alcohol ingestion,Aging,Exposure to particular emission from diesel engines,Solar irradiation,,4,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma affects about 30,000 Americans each year. Ninety percent are smokers. Alcohol is also a risk factor. Early, curable lesions are rarely symptomatic; thus, preventing fatal disease requires early detection by screening. Most of which occur after age 50. Oral squamous cell carcinoma is the most common oral or pharyngeal cancer. The chief risk factors for oral squamous cell carcinoma are smoking (especially  2 packs/day) and alcohol use. Risk increases dramatically when alcohol use exceeds 6 oz of distilled liquor, 6 oz of wine, or 12 oz of beer/day. The combination of heavy smoking and alcohol abuse is estimated to raise the risk 100-fold in women and 38-fold in men.",,

1510,1,Medicine,A 72 year old man on physical examination is found to have expressive dysphasia and mild right arm weakness. The most probable location of his lesion is: ,Right parietal lobe,Left frontal lobe,Right frontal lobe,Left parietal lobe,Basal ganglia,,2,"The frontal lobes are essential for planning and executing learned and purposeful behaviors; they are also the site of many inhibitory functions. There are at least 4 functionally distinct areas in the frontal lobes: the primary motor cortex in the precentral gyrus (the most posterior part) and the medial, orbital, and lateral frontal areas (termed the prefrontal areas).Lesions of the inferolateral frontal area (Broca's area) cause expressive aphasia (impaired comprehension or expression of words). Lesions of the dorsolateral frontal area can impair the ability to retain information and process it in real time (eg, to spell words backwards, to alternate between letters and numbers sequentially).In the primary motor cortex, all of the moving parts on one side of the body are controlled by the contralateral side. Because 90% of motor fibers from each hemisphere cross the midline in the brain stem, damage to the motor cortex of one hemisphere causes weakness or paralysis on the opposite side of the body.",,

He is alert and oriented with no neck stiffness. Anisocoria is present. The most likely diagnosis is ,Intracranial bleed,Cluster headache,Meningitis,Migraine headache,Tension headache,,1,"In an intracranial bleed, many symptoms result from increased intracranial pressure. The most common is headache. Headache may be most intense when patients awake from deep sleep (usually several hours after falling asleep) because hypoventilation, which increases cerebral blood flow and thus intracranial pressure, is usually maximal during sleep. When intracranial pressure is very high, the headache may be accompanied by vomiting, which may occur with little preceding nausea. Anisocoria is a condition characterized by an unequal size of the pupils, is also a sign of an intracranial bleed.",,

If papilledema is protracted, it may lead to visual disturbances, optic atrophy, and eventually blindness.In addition to the above, if mass effect is present with resulting displacement of brain tissue, additional signs may include pupillary dilatation, abducens (Cranial nerve VI) palsies, and the Cushing's triad. Cushing's triad involves an increased systolic blood pressure, a widened pulse pressure, bradycardia, and an abnormal respiratory pattern. In children, a slow heart rate is especially suggestive of high ICP.Irregular respirations occur when injury to parts of the brain interfere with the respiratory drive.

It can occur at any level distal to the duodenum of the small intestine and is a medical emergency. The main causes of small bowel obstruction are adhesions from previous abdominal surgery and hernias containing bowel. Depending on the level of obstruction, bowel obstruction can present with abdominal pain, abdominal distension, vomiting, fecal vomiting, and constipation.Conservative treatment involves insertion of a nasogastric tube, correction of dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities. Opioid pain relievers may be used for patients with severe pain. Antiemetics may be administered if the patient is vomiting. Adhesive obstructions often settle without surgery. If obstruction is complete and the patient worsens despite conservative management, a surgery is required.",,

She first noticed it several months ago and believes it has increased in size since then. Her mother and maternal aunt were diagnosed with breast cancer in their early 50's. She has no other health complaints. A subsequent mammogram shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the gold standard for evaluating this patient's breast mass? ",Mastectomy,Ultrasound,MRI,Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy,Excisional biopsy,,5,"Breast cancer most often involves glandular breast cells in the ducts or lobules. Most patients present with an asymptomatic lump discovered during examination or screening mammography. If advanced cancer is suspected based on physical examination, biopsy should be done first; otherwise, the approach is as for breast lumps. A prebiopsy bilateral mammogram may help delineate other areas that should be biopsied and provides a baseline for future reference. However, mammogram results should not alter the decision to perform a biopsy. Biopsy can be needle or incisional biopsy or, if the tumor is small, excisional biopsy. Excisional biopsy is the gold standard for evaluating breast masses. It is performed in an operating room under local or general anesthesia and results in the removal of the entire lesion.Although MRI is highly sensitive (85 to 100 percent), it lacks specificity (47 to 67 percent). MRI is inferior to mammography in detecting in situ cancers and cancers smaller than 3 mm, and it provides no cost benefit over excisional biopsy for verifying malignancy.Ultrasonography can effectively distinguish solid masses from cysts, which account for approximately 25 percent of breast lesions. When strict criteria for cyst diagnosis are met, ultrasonography has a sensitivity of 89 percent and a specificity of 78 percent in detecting abnormalities in symptomatic women. Although ultrasonography is not considered a screening test, it is more sensitive than mammography in detecting lesions in women with dense breast tissue.",,

Surgical treatment may be effective for pain relief. A pancreatic pseudocyst, which may cause chronic pain, can be decompressed into a nearby structure to which it firmly adheres (eg, the stomach) or into a defunctionalized loop of jejunum.

The most appropriate imaging study is ",MRI of skull and contents,Skull films,Head CT with contrast,Head CT without contrast,CT myelogram,,4,"In suspected intracranial bleeds it is important to do a CT of the head without contrast. The reason is because both contrast and blood look white on a CT image. Therefore contrast is not indicated in the imaging of the head, during an episode of likely intracranial bleeding or hemorrhage. CT of the head with contrast is done when a tumor or intracranial mass is suspected, for example in a patient that presents with headache, vomiting and papilledema.",,

Patients have sudden attacks of vertigo lasting up to 24 hours, usually with nausea and vomiting. There is no diagnostic test. Vertigo and nausea are treated with anticholinergics or benzodiazepines. Diuretics and a low-salt diet may decrease frequency and severity of episodes. For severe cases, the vestibular system can be ablated with topical gentamicin or surgery.The vertigo in Meniere's Disease is thought to result from an accumulation of excessive fluid in the inner ear. The fluid pressure stretches the membranes, that divide the compartments of the inner ear. As the membranes of the inner ear stretch, hearing diminishes and tinnitus worsens. When the membranes are severely stretched, the fluids of the inner ear may rupture them. This results in mixing of the fluids, one rich in sodium, the other rich in potassium. The mixture of these fluids is thought to bring on the vertigo. ",,

Air continues to get into the pleural space but cannot exit. Without proper treatment, the impaired venous return can cause systemic hypotension and respiratory and cardiac arrest within minutes. Tension pneumothorax most commonly occurs in patients receiving positive-pressure mechanical ventilation (particularly during resuscitation). It is rarely a complication of traumatic pneumothorax, when a chest wound acts as a one-way valve that traps increasing volumes of air in the pleural space with inspiration.

People who have received radiation treatment to the neck, usually for a noncancerous condition in infancy or childhood or for some other cancer in adulthood, are at greater risk of developing papillary cancer.",,
1542,4,Pediatrics,A 3 year old white female is brought to your office because she is complaining of pain in her right arm. Her mother tells you the pain began after she pulled her daughter by the arm while the girl was fighting with her brother. You examine the child and diagnose &ldquo;nursemaid's elbow&rdquo;. You recommend which one of the following? ,Manipulation of the forearm to reduce radial head subluxation,Long arm cast immobilization,Use of a sling for arm rest,A cock-up wrist splint,,,1,"Subluxation of the radial head (nursemaid's elbow) is a common childhood orthopedic problem. There is conflicting information in various textbooks on the proper technique to reduce the subluxed radial head. However, a study comparing hyperpronation to supination/flexion found that hyperpronation had a higher success rate. If a fracture is diagnosed, then a sling would be helpful. Neither a wrist splint nor a long arm cast is helpful in this situation.",,
1543,2,OBGYN,"A 39 year old black multigravida at 36 weeks gestation presents with a temperature of 40.0&deg;C (104.0&deg;F), chills, backache and vomiting. On physical examination, the uterus is noted to be nontender. There is slight bilateral costovertebral angle tenderness. A urinalysis reveals many leukocytes, some in clumps, as well as numerous bacteria. Of the following, the most appropriate therapy at this time would be ","Oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra)",Oral nitrofurantoin (Macrodantin),Oral levofloxacin,Intravenous doxycycline (Vibramycin),Intravenous ceftriaxone (Rocephin),,5,"Pyelonephritis is the most common medical complication of pregnancy. The diagnosis is usually straightforward, as in this case. Since the patient is quite ill, treatment is best undertaken in the hospital, at least until the patient is stabilized and cultures are available. Ampicillin is widely used as an agent of first choice, but because of variable drug resistance some studies suggest adding an aminogycoside for a woman who is seriously ill. Alternatively, an extended-spectrum penicillin or a third-generation cephalosporin may be used.Sulfonamides are contraindicated late in pregnancy because they may increase the incidence of kernicterus. Tetracyclines are contraindicated because administration late in pregnancy may lead to discoloration of the child's deciduous teeth. Nitrofurantion may induce hemolysis in women who are deficient in G-6-PD, which includes approximately 2% of black women. The safety of levofloxacin in pregnancy has not been established, and it should not be used unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk.",,

Because there is somatic innervation, the pain is intense, and increases with edema. Treatment involves excision of the acutely thrombosed tissue under local anesthesia, mild pain medication, and sitz baths. It is inappropriate to use procedures that would increase the pain, such as banding or cryotherapy. Total hemorrhoidectomy is inappropriate and unnecessary.",,

A red, papular rash with scaling is present on the trunk and proximal extremities. The lesions are 1-3 cm in diameter. This presentation is most consistent with: ",Scarlet fever,Guttate psoriasis,Atopic dermatitis,Scabies,Erythema marginatum,,2,"Guttate psoriasis occurs predominantly in children and is characterized by small oval lesions on the trunk and proximal extremities. The onset frequently follows a streptococcal respiratory infection. Scarlet fever usually accompanies streptococcal paryngitis and the rash is red, punctate, and often felt more readily than seen. Atopic dermatitis is characterized by chronic dry skin which is pruitic. Scabies is not related to streptococcal infection and is a popular, itchy rash seen on the finger webs, axillae, belt line, and genital areas. Erythema marginatum is a manifestation of rheumatic fever and is a nonspecific macular lesion of the trunk with central blanching that appears serpiginous.",,

Dystonia can be cause by any agent that blocks dopamine, including prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, and typical neuroleptic agents such as haloperidol. The treatment is to discontinue the offending agent. For the relief of an acute dystonic reaction, 1-2 mg of benztropine mesylate may be given IV, followed by 1-2 mg orally twice daily to prevent recurrence.",,

This patient was age 62 when he received the vaccine, indicating he should be revaccinated at the time of the health maintenance visit. Data from a single epidemiologic study suggest that the vaccine may provide protection for at least 9 years after receipt of the initial dose; however, data to support the need for subsequent doses of pneumococcal vaccine are not available, and because there is insufficient data concerning the safety of pneumococcal vaccine when administered three or more times, revaccination following a second dose is not routinely recommended.",,

She also complains of 1 hour of morning stiffness. She denies rash, fever, or skin changes. On physical examination she has symmetric swelling of the proximal interphalangeal joints and metacarpophalangeal joints. Motion of these joints is painful. She has no rash or mouth ulcers. Radiographs of the hands and wrists are negative, and a chest film is unremarkable. Her CBC is normal, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is elevated at 40 mm/hr. Latex fixation for rheumatoid factor is negative, and an antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is negative. The most likely diagnosis in this patient is: ",Rheumatoid arthritis,Systemic lupus erythematosus,Sarcoidosis,Lyme disease,Calcium pyrophosphate desposition disease,,1,"The patient has rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by symptoms and physical findings. A positive latex fixation test for rheumatoid factor is not necessary for the diagnosis. A negative rheumatoid factor does not exclude RA, and a positive rheumatoid factor is not specific. Rheumatoid factor is found in the serum of approximately 85% of adult patients with RA; in subjects without RA, the incidence of positive rheumatoid factor is 1%-5% and increases with age.The ANA test is positive in at least 95% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but in only about 35% of patients with RA. Elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is seen in many patients with RA, and the degree of elevation roughly parallels disease activity. A mean of 6 months after the onset of Lyme disease, 60% of patients in the U.S. have brief attacks of asymmetric, oligoarticular arthritis, primarily in the large joints and especially in the knee.",,

",Injection drug use,Sexual transmission,Perinatal maternal-child transmission,Occupational exposure of health-care workers,Household and day-care contact,,1,"Illegal drug use is currently the leading cause of new cases of hepattis C. It is estimated that 60% of new cases of hepatitis C in Canada are due to injection drug use. Intranasal cocaine use has been associated with hepatitis C, but its importance as a route of transmission is controversial and it occurs at a much lower frequency, if at all.Sexual transmission of hepatitis C is a less frequent cause of initial infection. Hepatitis B and HIV are transmitted more efficiently by sexual contact. Men who engage in homosexual intercourse have rates of hepatitis C similar to those of heterosexuals who engage in high-risk sexual practices. Among partners who are hepatitis C-positive, male-to-female transmission seems to be more efficient.Maternal-child perinatal transmission rates are thought to be less than 6%. Breastfeeding is not thought to be a risk. Occupational transmission is infrequent. No significant household or day-care risk is thought to exist in the absence of blood exposure.",,

In the last 9 months she has withdrawn from a master's degree program and has requested a leave of absence from her job as a teacher. Her husband says that she no longer will accept social engagements, and that she was formerly highly active in church and teaching Sunday school, but has also withdrawn from these activities. Her marriage remains strong, she sleeps well, and she continues independent running and cycling. Which one of the following would be appropriate as initial treatment? ",Lithium,Paroxetine (Paxil),Haloperidol (Haldol),Alprazolam (Xanax),Trazodone (Desyrel),,2,"Paroxetine has emerged as the drug of choice for treatment of social phobias. Also known as social anxiety disorder, social phobias characteristically cause fear of situations that may lead to embarrassing scrutiny. Patients learn to avoid situations where they fell others may notice them such as church gatherings, classroom settings, and other group events. Lithium and haloperidol are used for more severe psychiatric disturbances, while alprazolam would be best reserved for secondary use because of the possibility of dependency. Trazodone is approved for treatment of depression, but its strong sedative properties make it inappropriate in this scenario.",,
1552,6,Surgery,"A 70 year old Asian male presents with hematochezia. He has stable vital signs. Lower endoscopy is performed, but is unsuccessful due to active bleeding. Which one of the following would be the next appropriate investigation? ",An abdominal CT scan,A barium enema,A technetium-99m blood pool scan,Exploratory laparotomy,A small-bowel radiograph,,3,"In most patients with heavy gastrointestinal bleeding, localizing the bleeding site, rather than diagnosing the cause of the bleeding, is the most important task. A lower GI series is usually nondiagnostic during heavy, active bleeding. A small-bowel radiograph may be helpful after the active bleeding has stopped, but not during the acute phase of the bleeding. A blood pool scan allows repeated scanning over a prolonged period of time, with the goal of permitting enough accumulation of the isotope to direct the arteriographer to the most likely source of the bleeding. If the scan is negative, arteriography would also be unlikely to reveal the active source of bleeding. It is also a more invasive procedure. Exploratory laparotomy may be indicated if a blood pool scan or an arteriogram is nondiagnostic and the patient continues to bleed heavily.",,

Thirty minutes after you leave the delivery room, the delivery nurse calls you urgently to report that the mother's blood pressure is 80 mm Hg systolic and that the bed is soaked with blood. The most likely cause of this problem is ",Occult cervical lacerations,Uterine atony,Uterine rupture,Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy,,,2,"Ninety percent of early and immediate postpartum hemorrhage is due to failure of the uterus to contract satisfactorily (uterine atony). Other less frequent causes are lacerations of the cervix, vagina, or perineum; hematomas, usually located near lacerations or episiotomy repairs; and uterine rupture, either spontaneous or iatrogenic. All of these occur in the immediate postpartum period. Delayed hemorrhage, occurring beyond the first 24 hours after delivery, is usually caused by retained placental fragments. Interestingly, placenta accreta is among the most common causes of postpartum hemorrhage necessitating hysterectomy.",,

Headache, mental confusion, nausea, and malaise are common. Seizures, stupor, and coma generally do not occur until sodium concentrations fall below 120 mEq/L. The presence of significant peripheral edema in this patient indicates extracellular fluid volume expansion, and his serum osmolality is low. In this situation, hyponatremia is usually a manifestation of an edematous state, such as hepatic cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, or the nephritic syndrome. Although these patients have increase extracellular fluid, their intravascular fluid is depleted, and their body's attempt to conserve sodium at the level of the kidney produces urine with a sodium concentration &lt; 20 mEq/L. They have approximately increased arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels, resulting in a urine osmolality that is less than maximally dilute and often &gt; 100 mOsm/kg H2O.Patients with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) have normal volume status and urine sodium levels which are typically &gt; 20 mEq/L. Patients with primary polydipsia often have an underlying psychiatric disorder. They have normal volume status, and produce large volumes of very dilute urine (&lt; 50 mOsm/kg H2O).

",Digitalis,Beta-Adrenergic blockers,Calcium channel blockers,Class 1 A antiarrhythmics,,,2,"For long-term therapy, Beta-adrenergic antagonist drugs provide the most effective control of heart rate in atrial fibrillation, both at rest and during exercise. Although calcium channel blockers also lower heart rate both at rest and with exercise, they are not as effective as Beta-blockers. Digitalis is primarily effective in controlling the heart rate at rest, and often does not adequately control heart rate with exercise. The Class 1 antiarrhythmics are most useful in maintaining sinus rhythm and, in fact, may paradoxically increase heart rate.",,

More recent data indicate clearly that cervical cancer and genital warts result from different HPV types and do not appear to be linked. Specifically, external genital warts usually contain HPV types 6 or 11, and cervical cancer is associated with HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, and others. In the 1970s, it was demonstrated that a single sexual contact with a person infected with external genital warts carries about a 60% chance of transmission. A history of multiple partners is the most important risk factor for acquiring HPV infection. Because it is not possible to culture papillomavirus in cells, alternative methods are used to detect genital HPV expression: inspection with the unaided eye or with hand-held lens magnification, colposcopy, cytologic smears or biopsies, and viral DNA detection methods.",,

The major components of caloric expenditure are the basal metabolic rate, dietary thermogenesis, and physical activity. The basal metabolic rate (the amount of energy required to maintain metabolic homeostasis) accounts for 60%-70% of caloric expenditure. Dietary thermogenesis (the energy required for digestion and metabolism of food) accounts for 5%-10% of caloric expenditure and depends upon the amount and type of food eaten and, to an extent, on the degree of obesity.

When screening a child for reflux, the initial test should be voiding cystourethrography. Although renal ultrasonography is less invasive, findings are normal in 50%-75% of patients with reflux. A DMSA renal flow scan is the best study for detecting renal scarring, but will not detect reflux in children who have not yet developed scarring. Nuclear cystography is as sensitive for detecting reflux as a standard VCUG, but grading of reflux is less precise and this test will not detect associated bladder abnormalities.",,

This method is considered effective if given within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse.Levonorgestrel in a dose of 0.75 mg (also called Plan B) is given in two doses 12 hours apart, also within 72 hours. This dose is equivalent to 10 pills of the levonorgestrel progestin-only minipill. Plan B may be better tolerated, but is not as readily available in family physicians' offices.Endometrial aspiration is not 100% effective, and if it were used for contraception many unnecessary procedures would be done. Diethylstilbestrol was the choice for MAP for a few years but is rarely used now; in addition, the correct dosage is 25-50 mg/day for 5 days. Nausea and menstrual irregularity were common side effects, and both physicians and patients were uneasy about using a potential teratogen.

Vaginal ultrasonography can be used to detect intrauterine pregnancy as early as 1 week after conception if the Beta-hCG level is  1500 mIU/mL. An empty uterus with a Beta-hCG level  1500 mIU/mL is highly suggestive of ecoptic pregnancy. When the Beta-hCG is  1500 mIU/mL and vaginal ultrasonography is nondiagnostic, the Beta-hCG should be repeated in 2-3 days. Failure of the Beta-hCG to double in 2-3 days suggests a blighted ovum or ectopic pregnancy. The efficacy of progesterone in early pregnancy has not been proven, and there is some potential risk (virilization of the female fetus). An ectopic pregnancy is possible in this situation, but would be more like if the hCG were higher in the presence of an empty uterus, or if there were an adnexal mass on physical examination or ultrasonography.",,

His heart rate is 55/min and his blood pressure is 220/115 mm Hg. His temperature and respirations are reported as normal. There has been no vomiting and his neurologic examination is unchanged. The most likely diagnosis is ",Cluster headache,Autonomic hyperreflexia,Sepsis,Intracranial hemorrhage,Progression of the spinal cord lesion,,2,"Autonomic hyperreflexia is characterized by the sudden onset of headache and hypertension in a patient with a lesion above the T6 level. There may be associated bradycardia, sweating, dilated pupils, blurred vision, nasal stuffiness, flushing, or piloerection. It usually occurs several months after the injury and has an incidence as high as 85% in quadriplegic patients. Frequently, it subsides within 3 years of injury, but it can recur at any time. Bowel and bladder distension are common causes. Hypertension is the major concern because of associated seizures and cerebral hemorrhage.Cluster headaches have a constant unilateral orbital localization. The pain is steady (non-throbbing) and lacrimation and rhinorrhea may be part of the syndrome. Sepsis is usually manifested by chills, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Common signs include tachycardia and hypotension rather than bradycardia and hypertension. Signs and symptoms of intracranial hemorrhage vary depending upon the site of the hemorrhage, but the unchanged neurologic status and the lack of a history of hypertension decrease the likelihood of this diagnosis.

However, it is important to mention that, to date, there is no evidence to demonstrate a teratogenic risk from any currently available vaccines (e.g., mumps, measles, rubella varicella).Immunity to varicella should be reviewed in the context of maternal health care, and vaccination should be recommended as soon as appropriate. Since the varicella vaccine is an attenuated virus vaccine (two preparations are avail- able in Canada and both are live), it should not be given in pregnancy. A program of administration to susceptible post partum women should be developed. A second dose is recommended and should be administered approximately four weeks after the first. ",,

A lymphocyte count provides a quick estimate of immune status and low counts may indicate a need for nutritional assessment. Iron studies are more likely to be abnormal as a result of gastrointestinal blood loss. Folate level mostly reflect generic nutritional deficiency, rather than a specific deficiency. A low folate level is consistent with consumption of a limited variety and quantity of food. Electrolyte levels do not reflect nutrition.",,

The risk for this cancer increases with age, with the greatest incidence in postmenopausal women. Screening for early detection of ovarian malignancies has not proven effective, and its benefit is quite controversial even in patients with a known genetic risk. Thus, primary prevention may prove to be the most important method for reducing morbidity and mortality from this malignancy.The pathogenesis of ovarian cancer is unclear, but it is strongly believed that constant, uninterrupted ovulation may lead to an increased risk. This may explain why events such as pregnancy, breastfeeding, and oral contraceptive use are associated with a decreased risk of ovarian cancer, while the use of fertility drugs poses an increased risk. Postmenopausal use of hormone replacement therapy is also associated with an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer, although the effect is weak and the overall risk is low.",,

Contrast exposure for coronary arteriography is one possible cause of his renal failure.Sonography or spiral CT could be done without contrast to rule out an obstruction or stone. Bladder catheterization carries a risk of infection, but would be useful in ruling out bladder outlet obstruction in an elderly male. It might also prove therapeutic.

Laboratory findings in most patients with primary hyperparathyroidism reflect the mild clinical presentation of the disorder. The serum calcium level is often 1 mg/dL or more above the upper limits of normal.Bone radiographs may show the classic changes of subperiosteal bone resorption in the occasional patient with hyperparathyroidism, but in most cases they are normal or may show osteopenia. Osterocalcin is an osteroblast-specific protein. It is a marker of increased skeletal turnover, and it is usually not indicated clinically. The development of highly sensitive and specific assays for intact, largely active PTH has simplified the assessment of parathyroid activity. Bone densitometry is a test to determine the degree of osteoporosis.Hypercalcemia is not a side effect of ACE inhibitor use",,

In diabetics, metformin and thiazolidinediones (e.g., rosiglitazone) are more likely to improve lipid levels than are sulfonylureas. Nucotinic acid is problematic in diabetics, as it tends to cause deterioration in glucose control. Fibrates are good choices for this patient because they will lower the triglyceride level and raise the HDL level. Exercise and weight loss are likely to be helpful as well.

However, acute symptoms that do not respond to Beta-agonists should be treated with a short course of systemic corticosteroids.Theophylline has limited usefulness for treatment of acute symptoms in patients with intermittent asthma; it is a less potent bronchodilator than subcutaneous or inhaled adrenergic drugs, and therapeutic serum concentrations can cause transient adverse effects such as nausea and central nervous system stimulation in patients who have not been taking the drug continuously.Cromolyn can decrease airway hyperactivity, but has no bronchodilating activity and is useful only for prophylaxis. Inhaled corticosteroids should be used for suppressing the symptoms of chronic persistent asthma.

",A repeat mammogram in 3 months,Repeat fine-needle aspiration in 3 months,An excisional biopsy of the mass,Referral for breast irradiation,Referral to a surgeon for simple mastectomy,,3,"In the ideal setting, the accuracy of fine-needle aspiration may be over 90%. Clinical information is critical in interpreting the results of fine-needle aspiration  more so than with a tissue biopsy because of the more limited sampling. It is crucial to determine whether the findings on fine-needle aspiration explain the clinical findings. Although the report from the mammogram and the biopsy are not ominous, they do not explain the clinical findings in this case. Immediate repeat fine-needle aspiration or, even better, a tissue biopsy is indicated. Proceeding directly to therapy, whether surgery or irradiation, is inappropriate because the diagnosis is not clearly established. Likewise, any delay in establishing the diagnosis is not appropriate.",,

1603,1,Medicine,"A previously alert, otherwise healthy 74 year old black male has a history of slowly developing progressive memory loss and dementia associated with urinary incontinence and gait disturbance resembling ataxia. This presentation is most consistent with: ",Normal pressure hydrocephalus,Alzheimer's disease,Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis,Multiple sclerosis,,,1,"In normal pressure hydrocephalus a mild impairment of memory typically develops gradually over weeks or months, accompanied by mental and physical slowness. The condition progresses insidiously to severe dementia. Patients also develop an unsteady gait and urinary incontinence, but there are no signs of increased intracranial pressure.In Alzheimer's disease the brain very gradually atrophies. A disturbance in memory for recent events is usually the first symptom, along with some disorientation to time and place; otherwise, there are no symptoms for some period of time. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis usually occurs in children and young adults between the ages of 4 and 20 years and is characterized by deterioration in behavior and work. The most characteristic neurologic sign is mild clonus.Multiple sclerosis is characteristically marked by recurrent attacks of demyelinization. The clinical picture is pelomorphic, but there are usually sufficient typical features of incoordination, paresthesias, and visual complaints. Mental changes may occur in the advanced stages of the disease. About two-thirds of those affected are between the ages of 20 and 40.",,
1604,1,Medicine,A 67 year old female is concerned about osteoporosis. The study of choice for determining whether or not she has osteoporosis is: ,Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) of the hip and spine,A quantititative CT scan of the hip and spine,Plain radiographs of the hip and spine,Ultrasonography of the heel,A DEXA scan of the middle phalanx of the non-dominant hand,,1,"Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) of the hip and spine is the method of choice for assessment of bone mineral density. Quantitative CT is the most sensitive method, but results in substantially greater radiation exposure. Plain radiographs are no sensitive enough to diagnose osteoporosis until total bone density has decreased by 50%. The predictive value of DEXA scans and ultrasound examinations of peripheral bones in assessing fracture risk at the hip of verterbrae is not clear.",,
1605,1,Medicine,Within a 2-week period you see an unusually large number of patients of all ages who complain of painless loss of central vision. You refer them appropriately to an ophthalmologist. The feedback you get is that most of these persons have bilateral central scotomas caused by an ophthalmoscopically visible macular defect. Which one of the following events would most likely explain this problem? ,A solar eclipse,A factory accident exposing persons over a wide area to dangerous levels of carbon monoxide,A severe dust storm,The recent winner-take-all boxing tournament,The annual community picnic where lots of potato salad was consumed,,1,"Direct observation of the sun without an adequate filter, which often occurs during a solar eclipse, results in a specific type of radiation injury termed solar (eclipse) retinopathy. The lens system of the eye focuses the sun's light onto a small spot on the macula, usually in one eye only, producing a thermal burn. The resulting retinal edema may clear spontaneously with minor functional loss, or it may cause significant tissue atrophy, leaving a defect seen with an opthalmoscope as a macular hole. This macular injury produces a permanent central scotoma. Visual blurring and difficulty with light perception are reversible manifestations of the tissue hypoxia associated with carbon monoxide poisoning. Dust and other particulate matter can produce injury to the cornea and conjunctiva. These lesions are painful, usually prompting medical attention and appropriate treatment. While severe contusions to the globe and periorbital structures can produce retinal detachment, the clinical vignette does not support a boxing-type injury. Although potatoes have eyes, there is no other significant relationship between potato salad and ophthalmologic disease.",,

The use of loop diuretics such as furosemide should be restricted to patients in danger of fluid overload, since these drugs can aggravate volume depletion and are not very effective alone in prompting renal calcium excretion.

1608,3,PMCH,"A new drug treatment is shown to reduce the incidence of a complication of a disease by 50%. If the usual incidence of this complication were 1% per year, how many patients with this disease would have to be treated with this medication for 1 year to prevent one occurrence of this complication? ",20,50,100,200,500,,4,"Considering relative risk reduction without also considering the absolute rate can distort the importance of a therapy. A useful way to assess the importance of a therapy is to determine the number-needed-to-treat for that therapy. To calculate this number, the absolute risk reduction would be 0.5% (0.5 x .01). Thus, the number-needed-to-treat for the example cited would be 200 (100/0.5).More detailed explanation:NNT = 1/ARRWhere ARR = CER (Control Event Rate) - EER (Experimental Event Rate).The ARR is the amount by which your therapy reduces the risk of the bad outcome. For example, if your drug reduces the risk of a bad outcome from 50% to 30%, the ARR is:ARR = CER - EER = 0.5 - 0.3 = 0.2 (20%)In this specific case, the new drug reduces the incidence by 50% - from 1% to 0.5%).Therefore ARR = 1/100 - 0.5/100 = 0.005Then NNT = 1/0.005 = 200 ",,

",Osteomyelitis of the pubis,Stress fracture of the pubis,Osteitis pubis,Inguinal hernia,,,3,"Osteitis pubis is characterized by the chronic occurrence of pain in the lower abdomen and medial thighs with exercise. It produces tenderness over the pubic symphysis, and widening of the symphysis is often seen on plain radiographs. Pain from osteomyelitis is similar, but usually presents with fever and systemic symptoms, and does not cause widening of the symphysis.

There is a smaller volume of dilution for drugs distributed in body fluids. This may result in higher concentrations of medications, sometimes approaching toxic levels, especially if the usual adult dosages are given. Because elderly patients have a diminished thirst response, they are prone to develop hypernatremia when water is not immediately available.",,

Benefits have been shown for antenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum treatments. Zidovudine and nevirapine have the most well-established track record.Maternal vitamin A therapy has not proven to reduce HIV transmission. It was hoped that it would help maintain mucosal integrity. Chlorhexidine vaginal rinses in early labor have also not proven to reduce HIV transmission to the neonate. Cesarean section decreases the frequency of neonatal transmission of HIV, but with current viral suppression therapy the risk-to-benefit ratio of cesarean delivery is questionable. The immunologic benefits of breastfeeding do not balance the increased risk of HIV transmission to neonates who are breastfed by HIV-infected mothers.",,

Warfarin, which readily crosses the placenta, should be avoided throughout pregnancy. It is definitely teratogenic during the first trimester, and extensive fetal abnormalities have been associated with exposure to warfarin in any trimester.Because heparin does not cross the placenta, it is considered the safest anticoagulant to use during pregnancy. Initially, patients with venous thromboembolism during pregnancy should be managed with heparin given according to the recommendations for nonpregnant patients. These women should receive intravenous heparin for 5-10 days followed by subcutaneous heparin for the duration of the pregnancy. Warfarin can be given after delivery, since it is not present in breast milk.The indications for placement of an inferior vena cava filter are not changed by pregnancy, and include any contraindication to anticoagulant therapy, the occurrence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and recurrence of pulmonary embolism in a patient receiving adequate anticoagulant therapy.There are no data to support the use of aspirin for treatment or prophylaxis of pulmonary embolism either during or after pregnancy.",,

Lindane may be hazardous to young infants because of its percutaneous absorption and potential neurotoxicity. Permethrin is at least equally effective, and because it is poorly absorbed and rapidly metabolized, its toxicity is low. Crotamiton cream and sulphur in petrolatum are safe options, but must be applied continuously over 3.5 days. Laundering of clothing and bedclothes is sufficient to prevent reinfestation. In fact, clothes may simply be hung outside for 3-4 days, because the isolated mite dies within 2-3 days.",,

The diagnostic imaging procedure most likely to produce a specific diagnosis of his abdominal pain is: ",Intravenous pyelography (IVP),Sonography of the abdominal aorta,A barium enema,Celiac and mesenteric arteriography,Contrast venography,,4,"The sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea in a patient with a cardiac source of emboli and evidence of a separate embolic event makes superior mesenteric artery embolization likely. In this case, evidence of a brachial artery embolus and a cardiac rhythm indicating atrial fibrillation suggest the diagnosis. Some patients may have a surprisingly normal abdominal examination in spite of severe pain. Microscopic hematuria and blood in the stool may both occur with embolization. Severe leukocytosis is present in more than two-thirds of patients with this problem. Diagnostic confirmation by angiography is recommended.

A neutrophil count  250/mL is diagnostic for peritonitis. Once peritonitis is diagnosed, antibiotic therapy should be started immediately without waiting for culture results. Bloody ascites with abnormal cytology may be seen with hepatoma, but is not typical of peritonitis. The ascitic fluid pH does not become abnormal until well after the neutrophil count has risen, so it is a less reliable finding for treatment purposes.

In the past he has experienced moderate symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS), including headache, nausea, shortness of breath, and sleep disturbance. He has been otherwise healthy. Which one of the following has been shown to be helpful in minimizing or preventing the symptoms of AMS? ",Furosemide (Lasix),Erythromycin,Acetazolamide (Diamox),Beta-Blockers,Fluid restriction,,3,"Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is a clinical syndrome which may affect as many as 12%-67% of persons ascending to altitudes of 8000 feet or greater. While a standard definition of AMS does not exist, persons having three or more of the following symptoms may be considered to have AMS: headache, nausea, vomiting, sleep disturbance, anorexia, fatigue, or dyspnea. Gradual ascent is recommended to allow acclimatization.Measures which may help minimize symptoms include avoidance of alcohol, increased fluid intake, and a high-carbohydrate diet. Fluid restriction and diuretics should be avoided because of the diuresis associated with acclimatization, which may by itself cause dehydration. Antibiotics are of no benefit. -Blockers would be harmful, by interfering with the physiologic responses of tachycardia and increased cardiac output at higher altitudes. Acetazolamide speeds the process of acclimatization. The drug is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor which results in a renal bicarbonate diuresis and metabolic acidosis, thereby increasing ventilation and arterial oxygenation. The respiratory stimulation is particularly important during sleep, when it reduces the severe hypoxemia caused by periodic breathing. The drug also lowers cerebrospinal fluid volume and pressure, which may play an additional role in it s therapeutic and prophylactic utility.",,

Which one of the following is the most likely cause of her anemia? ,Iron deficiency,Lead poisoning,Chronic liver disease,Hemolysis,Hypothyroidism,,1,"This child has evidence of mild microcytic anemia, which is most commonly caused by iron deficiency related to reduce dietary intake. Less common causes are thalassemia and lead poisoning. Hemolysis usually causes a normocytic anemia with an elevated reticulocyte anemias.",,
1634,5,Psychiatry,"A 20 year old white male states that he was physically abused by his natural parents, and as a result of running away from home on several occasions was placed in a series of foster homes. His schooling was sporadic, and he was frequently in trouble for truancy, vandalism, initiating fights, and stealing. He dropped out of school at the age of 16, and during that year he was arrested for car theft and driving while intoxicated. He has not worked at any job for more than 6 months, and has had frequent changes of address due to failure to pay rent and other financial obligations. He brags that he has fathered three children by three different women, but has not provided any support of many any contact with any of them since their pregnancies. IQ testing is normal and there is no history of a psychotic break. The most accurate diagnosis of this patient's condition is ",Borderline personality disorder,Unipolar manic disorder,Antisocial personality disorder,Abused child reaction formation,Schizotypal personality disorder with psychoactive substance abuse,,3,"This patient meets the criteria for antisocial personality disorder, including age over 18, evidence of conduct disorder in childhood; a pattern of irresponsible and antisocial behavior since age 15, and absence of schizophrenia or manic episodes. Although the patient has some features of borderline personality disorder, such as unstable relationships, the persistently aggressive nature and lack of remorse are much more typical of antisocial personality. Although the boasting quality of the patient might appear somewhat grandiose, there are no other features to suggest mania. Abused child reaction formation is not a recognized diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Schizotypial personality disorder is not usually associated with such pervasive antisocial behavior and violence.",,

Polycystic ovaries are thought to be the result of anovulation, which in turn is likely due to a combination of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance which leads to abnormal hypothalamic secretion of Gn-RH. This results in a high level of estrogen, causing anovulation. Patients have higher levels of LH and low to low-normal levels of FSH. Diagnostic criteria include definite or probable menstrual dysfunction, clinical evidence of increased androgens, and the exclusion of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Findings which support the diagnosis include perimenarchal onset, insulin resistance, and elevated LH/FSH ratio, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasonography. As many as 25% of normal women may have polycystic ovaries when examined by ultrasonography but ultrasonography alone should not be the sole criterion for diagnosis. The use of metformin reduces insulin resistance and may normalize menstruation and restore ovaluation.",,
1637,1,Medicine,You are treating an 18 year old white male college freshman for allergic rhinitis. It is September and he tells you that he has severe symptoms every autumn which impair his academic performance. He has a strongly positive family history of atopic dermatitis. Which one of the following medications is considered optimal treatment for this condition? ,Intranasal glucocorticoids,Intranasal cromolyn sodium,Intranasal decongestants,Intranasal antihistamine,,,1,"Topical intranasal glucocorticoids are currently believed to be the most efficacious medications for the treatment of allergic rhinitis. They are far superior to oral preparations in terms of safety. Cromolyn sodium is also an effective topical agent for allergic rhinitis; however, it is more effective if started prior to the season of peak symptoms. Because of the high risk of rhinitis medicamentosa with chronic use of topical decongestants, these agents have limited usefulness in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.Some of the newer oral antihistamines have been found to be comparable in efficacy to intranasal steroids, but their use slightly increases the incidence of adverse effects and drug interactions. They are not as useful for congestion as for sneezing, pruritis, and rhinorrhea. Newer agents are relatively free of sedation. Overall, they are not as effective as topical glucocorticoids. Azelastine, an intranasal antihistamine, is effective in controlling symptoms but can cause somnolence and a bitter taste.",,

By giving the child a cookie, the mother is actually increasing the likelihood that the child will whine. Putting a child in time-out for whining would be an example of negative reinforcement. Letting the child continue to whine by ignoring the behavior is termed extinction.

This epidemiologic study uses ",A case-control design,A cross-sectional design,A clinical series,A cohort design,An experimental design,,1,"This study uses a case-control design. It is an explanatory study, as are the experimental, cross-sectional, and follow-up designs. A clinical series is not an explanatory study, but rather a descriptive study design. Like cross-sectional and follow-up designs, case-control is an observational design that begins with an outcome (e.g., testicular cancer) and then looks for common features (e.g., diet) among people who share that outcome. A cohort, or prospective, design begins with people who have not yet experienced an outcome: characteristics of the group to be studied are measured and catalogued, and then the researchers wait for the outcome.The cross-sectional design is an observational design that takes a population or cohort and makes a simultaneous assessment of outcomes and potential predictors. It is a slice-of-time design also referred to as a prevalence study. With the experimental design, one begins with a group free of the outcome, then divides the population into two groups, allowing and likewise limiting variables between each group to see how the outcome varies between the two groups. The clinical series is a descriptive type of study that records events, observations, and activities, but does not provide a detailed explanation for the cause of disease. This type of study often leads to the development of more in-depth explanatory studies.",,

The cyanotic form usually occurs after vigorous crying, while the pallid form commonly occurs after a sudden fright or minor injury. The history of a prodrome of injury, vigorous crying, or sudden fright is key to distinguishing a breath-holding spell from a seizure. Parents can be reassured that no brain damage occurs and, in the presence of a classic history, no further workup is necessary.

",The chances of symptoms remission after withdrawal of the haloperidol are greater than for a younger patient,Quickly reducing the dosage of haloperidol will lead to prompt worsening of her tardive dyskinesia,Long-term metoclopramide (Reglan) would bet the best treatment for her hiatal hernia,Risperidone (Risperidal) would be most likely than haloperidol to cause tardive dyskinesia,,,2,"Symptom remission is more likely to occur after neuoleptic withdrawal in young patients than in the elderly. Tardive dyskinesia is initially exacerbated by a reduction in neuroleptic dosage, and dyskinesias decrease following an increase in the dosage. Metoclopramide has been shown to cause tardive dyskinesia with long-term treatment, and therefore would not be the best drug for the patient' hiatal hernia. There is no convincing evidence that any of the traditional antipsychotic drugs is less likely to produce tardive dyskinesia than any other, but the newer atypical agents such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine offer some hope for a reduced incidence.",,
1666,2,OBGYN,Which one of the following single-dose regimens is effective for treatment of uncomplicated urethral or cervical infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis? ,"Azithromycin (Zithromax), 1 g orally","Doxycycline (Vibramcyin), 200 mg orally","Amoxicillin, 2 g orally","Cefixime (Supramax), 400 mg orally","Metronidazole (Flagyl), 2 g orally",,1,"Azithromycin, 1 g orally once, is effective for treatment of uncomplicated urethral or cervical infection caused by Chlamydial trachomatis. Doxycycline and amoxicillin are effective for this condition, but must be taken for 7-10 days. Cefixime and metronidazole are effective as single doses for uncomplicated gonorrhea and vaginal trichomoniasis respectively, but neither is indicated for the treatment of Chlamydia.",,
1667,1,Medicine,A 24 year old male presents with a painless lump in the right testis that was recently discovered by his sexual partner. The most useful initial diagnostic procedure is: ,Ultrasonography of the scrotum,A trans-scrotal biopsy of the lesion performed under local anesthesia in your office,A therapeutic trial of a quinolone antibiotic for 3 weeks to shrink the lesion,A Beta-hCG level,"Reassurance that benign lesions will generally regress, and reexamination in 4-6 weeks",,1,"Ultrasonography of the scrotum will distinguish intra- from extratesticular activity nearly 100% of the time. A trans-scrotal biopsy is absolutely contraindicated, since it could lead to inguinal node metastatic spread. Antibiotic trials are not indicated for intratesticular masses. Beta-hCG is produced by only a small number of testicular tumors. Watchful waiting is not appropriate for testicular masses, which are usually malignant. Doubling time of testicular cancers is thought to be 10-30 days.",,
1668,1,Medicine,"A 25 year old white male who has a poorly controlled major seizure disorder and a 6-week history of recurrent fever, anorexia, and persistent, productive coughing visits your office. On physical examination he is noted to have a temperature of 38.3C (101.0F), a respiratory rate of 16/min, gingival hyperplasia, and a fetid odor to his breath. Auscultation of the lungs reveals rales in the mid-portion of the right lung posteriorly. Which one of the following is most likely to be found on a chest radiograph? ",Sarcoidosis,Miliary calcifications,A lung abscess,A right hilar mass,A right pleural effusion,,3,"Anaerobic lung abscesses are most often found in a person predisposed to aspiration who complains of a productive cough associated with fever, anorexia, and weakness. Physical examination usually reveals poor dental hygiene, a fetid odor to the breath and sputum, rales, and pulmonary findings consistent with consolidation. Patients who have sarcoidosis usually do not have a productive cough and have bilateral physical findings. A persistent productive cough is not a striking finding in disseminated tuberculosis, which would be suggested by military calcifications on a chest film. The clinical presentation and physical findings are not consistent with a simple mass in the right hilum nor with a right pleural effusion.",,
1669,4,Pediatrics,"During a health maintenance examination, a 14 year old black male is noted to have asymmetric breast enlargement with mild tenderness. The remainder of the physical examination is normal. The most appropriate management in this case is to: ",Reassure the patient and have him return in 6 months,Order a chest radiograph,Order serum estrogen and testosterone levels,Order chromosomal studies,Arrange for a biopsy,,1,"Some gynecomastia occurs in 30%-50% of pubertal males. It typically appears between 12 and 15 years of age, at Tanner stages 2 and 3. Physiologic gynecomastia is usually mild and may be either unilateral or bilateral. Breast tenderness is common and also mild. The enlargement typically regresses within a few months to 2 years.Serum hormone levels are the same as in boys without gynecomastia, although the ratio of testosterone to estrogen is lower than in males at similar stages without the condition. There is no indication for chromosomal investigation or radiography. A biopsy should be considered only if the condition persists beyond mid-puberty.",,
1670,3,PMCH,Which one of the following is current recommendation regarding influenza vaccine?,Giving influenza vaccine to all persons age 50 and over,Giving influenza vaccine to persons under age 65 only if they are at high risk,Advising pediatric patients to receive influenza vaccine,Routinely giving pneumococcal vaccine whenever an initial influenza vaccination is given, Everyone 6 months of age and older should get vaccinated,,5,CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccine as the first and most important step in protecting against flu viruses.Everyone 6 months of age and older should get vaccinated against the flu as soon as the 2010-2011 season vaccine is available.,,
1671,5,Psychiatry,"A 40 year old male professional consults you about his recent onset of depression. He generally feels well, but sometimes feels &ldquo;high and out of control&rdquo;. This is followed by significant depression which usually remits after a long weekend of sleep at his cabin on the lake. He also complains of persistent nasal congestion and a 10-lb weight loss. His psychiatric history is negative, but he is suspicious and feels that people are against him. His mental status otherwise reveals normal thought content and processes. His physical examination is normal except for inflamed nares and enlarged nasal turbinates. The most likely diagnosis is ",Schizophrenia,Generalized anxiety disorder,Panic disorder,Alcohol abuse,Cocaine abuse,,5,"A chronic user of cocaine, like the chronic user of alcohol, does not always fit the classic description of dependence, and the physician must therefore consider the diagnosis in all patients with episodic depression and peculiar mood swings. Organic symptoms are like those of amphetamine use, mainly hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, and even cardiac arrhythmias. Routine, continued cocaine &ldquo;snorting&rdquo; often leads to nasal mucosal congestion and occasional septal perforation. Paranoid ideation is sometimes seen with the use of cocaine and other stimulants. The patient's age and normal mental status make schizophrenia unlikely. Panic disorder is not complicated by paranoid behavior.",,
1672,2,OBGYN,"A 72 year old white female has had annual Papanicolaou smears with normal findings for the past 30 years. She now finds it difficult and uncomfortable to undergo pelvic examinations because of severe arthritis in both hips, as well as vaginal atrophy. She has not been sexually active since the death of her husband 10 years ago. What is the most appropriate approach to further screening for cervical neoplasia in this patient? ",She should be screened every 3-5 years,"She should undergo a test for the presence of human papillomavirus; if it is negative, screening can be discontinued",She should undergo ultrasound examination of the pelvis every 3-5 years,Screening can be discontinued now,,,4,"Cervical neoplasia is thought to be the result of sexually acquired infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV). In the patient described, the likelihood of detecting an abnormality is minimal, and screening can therefore be safely stopped.",,
1673,2,OBGYN,Which one of the following is true concerning breastfeeding?,The first feeding should take place a few hours after delivery when the mother is well rested,Packets containing information about breastfeeding and samples of infant formula should be provided when mothers go home from the hospital,Ointment containing vitamins A and D should be applied to prevent cracked nipples,"When lactation is becoming established, infants should be weighed before and after a feeding to determine whether they are getting enough milk",Breastfeeding mothers should be taught that milk supply depends on the amount of suckling,,5,"Controlled trials have shown that delaying the first breastfeeding session until more than 2 hours after delivery, test weighing to determine the amount of milk ingested, and provision of formula samples to nursing mothers all substantially decreases the proportion of women successfully nursing by the first postpartum visit. Test weighing has also been shown to be inaccurate and unreliable. Ointment containing vitamins A and D was worse than nothing in clinical trials; the main effective preventive and remedial measure for sore nipples is correct positioning of the baby's mouth on the breast. New mothers should be taught the breastfeeding basics, including the fact that milk supply adjusts to the infant's demands, i.e., the frequency, vigor, and duration of suckling.",,
1674,3,PMCH,Which one of the following is the best screening test for hereditary hemochromatosis?,Hemoglobin,ALT (SGPT),Serum transferrin saturation,Serum iron,Liver biopsy,,3,"Hereditary hemochromatosis is one of the most common genetic disorders in Canada. Serum transferrin is the best and most sensitive screening test. Liver biopsy, long considered the gold standard for diagnosing hemochromatosis, is far too invasive. The other tests listed lack sensitivity or selectivity.",,

Which one of the following would be most cost-effective for evaluating this problem? ",MRI,A CT scan,A bone scan,Probing for bone at the base of the ulcer,"A CBC, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum calcium level",,4,"A recent study of foot ulcers in diabetics showed that finding palpable bone at the base of an ulcer with no intervening soft tissue had a higher positive predictive value than any type of imaging study, and correlated highly with the presence of underlying osteomyelitis. Other tests listed are less likely to be diagnostic and are much more expensive than simple probing of a wound.",,
1676,6,Surgery,"A 60 year old white female presents with pain in her left calf on walking. The pain does not go away with continued walking, and is relieved only by rest. She smokes a pack of cigarettes daily and has type 2 diabetes mellitus which is only moderately controlled with oral agents. She has been fairly noncompliant with dietary measures, and has not been interested in following your recommendations regarding medication for her hyperlipidemia. She is unable to do many of the things that she previously enjoyed doing, such as playing golf. Her ankle-brachial index at rest on the left is 0.60 and on the right is 1.10.

",Strict exercise training program,LDL-cholesterol &lt;130 mg/dL,Tight control of her diabetes.,"Reduction in walking distance, to decrease MI risks",,,1,"Exercise therapy for peripheral vascular disease (PVD) improves maximal treadmill walking distance and functional capacity. A rigorous exercise-training program may be as beneficial as bypass surgery and more beneficial than angioplasty. The goal LDL-cholesterol level in patients with established atherosclerotic vascular disease, including those with PVD (and all patients with diabetes mellitus) should be &lt; 100 mg/dL. Tight control of diabetes mellitus has not been shown to favorably affect PVD.",,

While reviewing her medical history, you note that she began timolol (Timoptic) eye drops 3 months ago for the treatment of glaucoma. Which one of the following findings is most likely related to the eye drops?",Bronchospasm,Elevated serum creatinine,Hirsuitism,Leukopenia,New-onset atrial fibrillation,,1,"Ophthalmic Beta-adrenergic antagonists often have systemic side effects. Beta2-Blockade can cause contraction of bronchial smooth muscle, leading to bronchospasm; respiratory failure and death due to bronchospastic complications have been reported, particularly in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",,
1678,1,Medicine,"A 70 year old black male who has been hospitalized for 2 1/2 weeks for congestive heart failure develops severe, persistent diarrhea. For the past 3 days he has had abdominal cramps and profuse semi-formed stools without mucus or blood.The patient's current medications include captopril (Capoten), digoxin, furosemide (Lasix), subcutaneous heparin, sprionolactone (Aldactone), and loperamide (Imodium). He has coronary artery disease, but has been relatively pain free since undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery 4 years ago. An appendectomy and cholecystectomy were performed in the past, and the patient has since been free of gastrointestinal disease.On physical examination his blood pressure is 100/80 mm Hg, pulse 100 beats/min and regular, and temperature 37.0&deg;C (98.6&deg;F). He has mild jugular venous distension and crackles at both lung bases. Examination of his heart is unremarkable, although there is 1+ dependent edema. His abdomen is diffusely tender without masses or organomegaly. Rectal examination is normal. The results of routine laboratory tests, including a CBC, chemistry profile, EKG, and urinalysis, are al normal. The stool examination shows numerous white blood cells. Of the following, the most likely diagnosis is: ",Viral gastroenteritis,Clostridium difficile colitis,Ulcerative colitis,Gluten-sensitive enteropathy (celiac sprue),Digoxin toxicity,,2,"This patient most likely has Clostridium difficile colitis, suggested by semiformed rather than watery stool, fecal leukocytes (not seen in viral gastroenteritis or sprue), and a hospital stay greater than 2 weeks. While this disease has traditionally been associated with antibiotic use, it is posing an increasing threat to patients in hospitals and chronic-care facilities who have not been given antibiotics. The primary sources for infection in such cases have been toilets, bedpans, floors, and the hands of hospital personnel. Prompt recognition and treatment is essential to prevent patient relapse and to minimize intramural epidemics. The diarrhea of ulcerative colitis usually contains blood and occurs intermittently over a protracted course. Digoxin toxicity is likely to be accompanied by electrocardiographic and laboratory abnormalities, particularly hyper- or hypokalemia.",,
1679,2,OBGYN,Which one of the following represents an advantage of injectable medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera)?,There is a general lack of menstrual irregularities,It is not causally linked with thromboembolic events,There is no weight gain,There is no measurable effect on blood lipid levels,The cost is half that of generic combination oral contraceptives,,2,Injectable medroxyprogesterone acetate is not causally linked with thromboembolic events. The most common side effect is menstrual irregularities; weight gain is also a bothersome side effect. There may be a decrease in HDL-cholesterol and an increase in LDL. The cost is similar to that of combination oral contraceptives.,,
1680,4,Pediatrics,"A 6 month old white male is brought to your office because he has blisters in his diaper area. You find large bullae filled with cloudy, yellow fluid. Some of the blisters have ruptured and the bases are covered with a thin crust. Which one of the following is most appropriate in the management of this condition? ",Use of a topical antifungal agent,Treating diapers with a vinegar rinse to remove residual ammonia,A course of penicillin to prevent acute glomerulonephritis,A course of penicillinase-resistant penicillin or a cephalosporin,,,4,"Bullous impetigo is a localized skin infection characterized by large bullae; it is caused by a group 2 phage type of Staphylococcus aureus. Cultures of fluid from an intact blister will reveal the causative agent. Ordinary penicillin is usually effective in streptococcal impetigo, but early treatment does not appear to lessen the occurrence of acute glomerulonephritis.",,
1681,6,Surgery,"According to evidence-based guidelines, which one of the following is an indication for hysterectomy for leiomyoma?",Difficulty making a diagnosis of ovarian cancer because of nonpalpable adnexa,A desire to avoid increased surgical morbidity due to continued uterine enlargement,"Persistent, severe pelvic discomfort caused by myomas",Prophylaxis for possible future symptoms,Prophylaxis for malignant leiomyosarcoma,,3,"Of the responses listed, only acute, severe pelvic discomfort caused by myomas is an indication for hysterectomy according to guidelines based on evidence-based criteria. The others have been indications in the past, but current quality assurance evidence no longer supports hysterectomy for these conditions.",,
1682,3,PMCH,Which one of the following is a contraindication to immunization with MMR?,The patient had a tuberculosis skin test (PPD) within the previous 2 days,A household member of the patient has an immunodeficiency,The mother of the patient is pregnant,The patient is pregnant,The patient is breastfeeding her newborn infant,,4,"The failure to provide immunizations because of perceived contraindications is one of the most common reasons for an inadequately protected population. A PPD may be falsely negative if administered 2-30 days after MMR administration, not the reverse. If the patient is immunodeficient or pregnant, rather than a household contact, then MMR is contraindicated. Breastfeeding is not a contraindication.",,
1683,1,Medicine,A 73 year old white male who is otherwise in good health noted a sudden shower of flashing lights before his left eye a few hours ago. He has never had this symptom before. The most likely diagnosis is: ,Migraine syndrome,Retinal detachment,Vitreous floaters,Central retinal vein thrombosis,Temporal lobe tumor,,2,"While all of the conditions listed are associated with flashing light before the eyes, a sudden shower of flashing lights is highly suggestive of retinal detachment. Migraine syndrome rarely begins in the eighth decade, vitreous floaters are more likely to be perceived as spots rather than lights, and central retinal vein thrombosis would likely cause more loss of vision. Emergency referral to an ophthalmologist is mandatory in cases of probable retinal detachment.",,
1684,3,PMCH,Combination oral contraceptives would be contraindicated in which one of the following?,A 25-year-old female whose body mass index is  30,A 26-year-old female with migraine headaches without focal neurologic symptoms,A 28-year-old smoker,A 30-year-old female with a previous history of deep venous thrombosis,A 42-year-old nonsmoker,,4,"According to the World Health Organization, an individual with a previous history of deep venous thrombosis should not use combination oral contraceptives. The advantages outweigh the disadvantages in nonsmokers over 40, smokers under the age of 35, and obese women. Combination contraceptives can be used with caution or special monitoring in individuals with migraine headaches without focal neurologic symptoms who are less than 35 years old.",,
1685,1,Medicine,Total parenteral nutrition is most appropriate for patients: ,With poorly functioning gastrointestinal tracts who cannot tolerate enteral feeding,Who cannot swallow because of an esophageal motility problem,Who refuse to eat,In whom maintenance nutrition is desired for a short period following recovery from surgery,,,1,"Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is indicated for patients with poorly functioning gastrointestinal tracts who cannot tolerate other means of nutritional support and for those with high caloric requirements that cannot otherwise be met. Patients who cannot swallow because of an esophageal motility problem and those who are resistant to feeding can be managed with tube feedings. Peripheral alimentation, which provides fewer calories than TPN or liquid tube feedings, would be more appropriate over the short term in patients recovering from surgery.",,
1686,3,PMCH,Which one of the following would be most likely to have secondary hypertension?,A 39-year-old white male who weighs 119 kg (262 lb) and whose blood pressure is 142/94 mm Hg,A 48-year-old black female with left ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiography whose blood pressure is 162/98 mm Hg,A 62-year-old black male with a strong family history of hypertension,A 78-year-old white female with abdominal bruits whose blood pressure is 182/102 mm Hg,An 88-year-old white male with hemiparesis due to a previous stroke whose blood pressure is 192/88 mm Hg,,4,"Physical findings which suggest secondary hypertension include the presence of abdominal bruits, particularly those that lateralize of have a diastolic component. Excess body weight is correlated closely with increased blood pressure, but is not a cause of secondary hypertension. Hypertension is the most important risk factor for stroke, but a history of stroke is not an indication of secondary hypertension. Left ventricular hypertrophy is a result of hypertension, but is not an indication of secondary hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension is greater in blacks than in whites, but black race is not a risk factor for secondary hypertension.",,
1687,6,Surgery,A 91 year old white male presents with a 6-month history of a painless ulcer on the dorsum of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the second toe. Examination reveals a hallus valgus and a rigid hammer toe of the second digit. His foot has mild to moderate atrophic skin changes and the dorsal and posterior tibial pulses are absent. Appropriate treatment includes which one of the following? ,Surgical correction of the hammer toe,Custom-made shoes to protect the hammer toe,Bunionectomy,A metatarsal pad,,,2,"The treatment of foot problems in the elderly is difficult because of systemic and local infirmities, the most limiting being the poor vascular status of the foot. Conservative, supportive, and palliative therapy replaces definitive reconstructive surgical therapy. Surgical correction of a hammer toe and bunionectomy would be disastrous in an elderly patient with a small ulcer and peripheral vascular disease. The correct approach to this patient is to prescribe custom-made shoes and a protective shield with a central apeture of foam rubber placed over the hammer toe. Metatarsal pads are not useful in the treatment of hallux valgus and a rigid hammer toe.",,
1688,5,Psychiatry,"A 10 year old male comes in for follow-up of his attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). At the time of his last visit 1 month ago he was taking methylphenidate (Ritalin) once daily each morning. At that time his mother reported that he did extremely well in class during the morning, but by the end of the day he was having problems with inattentiveness. This carried over into difficulties concentrating on homework after school. These problems were affecting his grades and causing distress to him and his mother. The child expressed a desire not to have to take medicine during the school day. You switched his medicine at that visit to a long acting form of methylphenidate (Concerta).At this visit the mother reports that her son is now doing well through the entire school day and is able to get his homework done. However, she notes that his appetite at dinner has decreased and that he has lost 2 lb. She also reports that it is somewhat more difficult for him to fall asleep. What is the most appropriate management at this point? ",Have him take the medication at bedtime,Reassure the mother and reevaluate in 1 month,"Add a dose of a tricyclic antidepressant such as nortiptyline (Aventyl, Pamelor), to be taken with the evening meal",Switch him to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) such as paroxetine (Paxil),,,2,"Anorexia with mild weight loss and difficulty falling asleep are common side effects of amphetamine treatment for ADHD. In most patients these side effects are tolerable and transient. While alternative drugs such as antidepressants can be substituted, these usually do not work as well and have their own potential side effects.",,
1689,2,OBGYN,"A 42 year old white female has a 2-month history of vaginal itching. Another physician prescribed three courses of antifungal therapy, but the condition persists. The patient says there has been no discharge, and there are no skin lesions anywhere else. The physical examination is remarkable only for a lacy white rash on the labia minora. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ",Atrophic vaginitis,Lichen planus,Contact dermatitis,Chronic candidiasis,Vaginal adenosis,,2,"This lesion fits best with the diagnosis of vulvar lichen planus, analogous to oral lichen planus. The genitals are a common site, and when mucous membranes are involved, there will be a lacy white or light gray reticulate pattern like that seen on the buccal mucosa with oral lesions. The cause of the condition is unknown, and it typically resolves spontaneously after 6-24 months. There is no treatment that shortens the disease, but topical corticosteroids may relieve the itching and improve cosmetic appearance. This woman is a little too young for atrophic vaginiti and a little too old for vaginal adenosis. Contact dermatitis is a nonspecific erythema without white patches. Chronic candidiasis in an otherwise healthy woman would be expected to respond to conventional therapy.",,
1690,6,Surgery,"A 62 year old male with a previous history of hypertension, smoking, and hypercholesterolemia comes to your office after being seen in the emergency department with an episode of dysarthria and weakness on the left side of his body. Physical examination reveals a right carotid bruit. Carotid ultrasonography shows 70%-80% stenosis of the right carotid artery, which is confirmed by magnetic resonance angiography. In addition to management of risk factors, which one of the following is appropriate? ",Long-term aspirin therapy,Aspirin plus clopidogrel (Plavix),Warfarin (Coumadin),Carotid endarterectomy,,,4,"Carotid stenosis is an important cause of transient ischemic attacks and stroke. For patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis of more than 70%, the value of carotid endarterectomy has been firmly established on the basis of three major randomized trials. Both the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASET) and the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) showed that only seven or eight patients would need to undergo endarterectomy to prevent one stroke in a 5-year period. The trial by the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program also showed that endarterectomy was the best treatment in this situation.",,
1691,6,Surgery,"A 38 year old male is admitted to the hospital after being found lying on the floor unconscious from a drug overdose. The next morning, he is alert and complains of constant pain in the anterior aspect of his left leg. On examination, you note pain with passive stretching, pain with palpitation anteriorly, and a slightly decreased dorsalis pedis pulse on the left. There is no edema or erythema. Radiographs of the lower extremity are normal. Which one of the following would you do now? ","Recommend rest, ice, and elevation, along with physical therapy",Begin empiric intravenous antibiotics,Order duplex Doppler ultrasonography of the left leg,Order impedance plethysmography of the left leg,Obtain immediate surgical consultation,,5,"The patient has a history and symptoms very suggestive of a compartment syndrome of the anterior compartment of the left leg. A common cause of this serious problem is limb compression during prolonged recumbency related to drug or alcohol overdose. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential in order to avoid permanent, severe disability.The five &ldquo;P's&rdquo; of compartment syndrome are pain, pallor, paresthesias, pulselessness, and paralysis. If distal pulses are reduced, then muscle necrosis has occurred and immediate surgical consultation is necessary. Duplex Doppler ultrasonography and impedance plethysmography are used to evaluate for deep venous thrombosis. Given the decreased pulses, however, this diagnosis is much less likely and such testing may needlessly delay urgent surgical treatment. Intravenuous antibiotics would be appropriate for cellulites. This diagnosis is unlikely in this scenario given the absence of fever, erythema, and edema, and the presence of a diminished pulse. Rest, ice, and elevation are inappropriate treatment modalities for compartment syndrome.",,

1695,1,Medicine,"A 35 year old male consults you about a vague chest pain he developed while sitting at his desk earlier in the day. The pain is right-sided and was sharp for a brief time when it began, but it rapidly subsided. There was no hemoptysis and the pain does not seem pleuritic. His physical examination, EKG, and oxygen saturation are unremarkable. A chest film shows a 10% right pneumothorax. Which one of the following is true in this situation? ",He is likely to be an overweight smoker with a chronic cough,Rupture of subpleural bullae would be an unlikely cause of his problem,Outpatient observation with a repeat chest radiograph in 24 hours is indicated,A chest tube should be placed expeditiously,After treatment his probability of recurrence is less than 15%,,3,"The majority of patients presenting with spontaneous pneumothorax are tall, thin individuals under 40 years of age. Most do not have clinically apparent lung disease, and the chest pain is sometimes minimal at onset and may resolve within 24 hours even if untreated. Patients with small pneumothorax involving less than 15% of the hemithorax may have a normal physical examination, although tachycardia is occasionally noted. The diagnosis is confirmed by chest radiographs. Studies of recurrence have found that an average of 30% of patients will have a recurrence within 6 months to 2 years. The treatment of an initial pneumothorax of less than 20% may be monitored if a patient has few symptoms. Follow-up should include a chest radiograph to assess stability at 24-48 hours. Indications for treatment include progression, delayed expansion, or the development of symptoms. The majority of patients with spontaneous pneumothoraces, and perhaps almost all of them, will have subpleural bullae on a CT scan.",,

She describes the pain as bilateral, deep in the pelvis, and intermittently cramping and steady. She has never been pregnant, although she has not been using any contraception during the 6 years she has been married. She is not interested in fertility at this time. She has no history of previous sexually transmitted disease, IUD use, or abdominal or pelvic surgery. She currently uses ibuprofen, 600 mg 3-4 times a day as needed, with moderate pain relief. She is a nonsmoker.Physical examination reveals a blood pressure of 120/70 mm Hg and normal findings on examination of the heart, lungs, and abdomen. The vagina and cervix are normal in appearance. Bimanual examination reveals a normal-sized uterus and adnexa with no masses, but mild tenderness on palpation of the posterior uterus and posterior cul-de-sac. Recent screening laboratory work was normal, including a CBC, thyroid function tests, lipid levels, and liver function tests. What is the most appropriate management at this time?

",It is readily used in breech presentations,The incidence of fetal facial nerve palsy is higher.,Associated with lower incidence of perineal tears,There is a higher rate of successful vaginal delivery,,,3,"Forceps operations have become less popular, and vacuum extraction (VE) procedures are more common in recent years. There is long-term debate concerning when assisted delivery is appropriate and which instrument (vacuum extractor or forceps), is bestIn breech presentations, VE use is contraindicated. A vaginal breech delivery is a potential indication for the application of forceps.Any instrumental delivery is associated with an increased risk of perineal/rectal injury versus the incidence of these complications following either a spontaneous or a cesarean delivery.

The syndrome is caused by pressure on the median nerve where it and the flexor tendons of the fingers pass through the tunnel formed by the carpal bones and the transverse carpal ligament.It usually begins with a gradual onset of numbness, tingling, and pain in the hand and wrist. Symptoms are often present at night, during sleep, and when the wrists are flexed. The symptoms occur in the thumb and the index and middle fingers, and occasionally in part of the fourth finger. The fifth finger is never involved. The thenar compartment is innervated by the median nerve and may atrophy as the syndrome progresses. The hypothenar musculature is not involved. Physical signs of CTS include a positive Phalen's maneuver, which is a provocation of symptoms by sustained wrist flexion. Symptoms can be precipitated by activities which require repeated flexions, pronation, and supination of the wrist, e.g., sewing, driving, operating computers and cash registers, and playing golf.",,

HIT is best envisioned as a state of excessive and unrestrained thrombin generation, and in this prothrombotic mileu warfarin treatment may intensify this state and must also be stopped. Direct thrombin inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for use as anticoagulants in patients with HIT. The primary treatment of HIT is to stop heparin and warfarin and substitute a non-heparin anticoagulant. A hypercoagulable state exists for several days after heparin is stopped, mandating continuation of monitoring and further antithrombotic measures.

",Surgery should be postponed until 3 years of age to allow for spontaneous descent,The risk of malignancy in the undescended testis is several times higher than in the general population,"Orchiopexy with antecedent hormonal therapy (LH-RH, hCG) is the currently recommended treatment",Orchiopexy eliminates the risk of testicular malignancy,"After orchiopexy, fertility is maintained in 30% of unilateral cases.",,2,"Over 4% of boys have an undescended testis at birth. The incidence is higher in premature infants. The majority of undescended testes spontaneously descend before the age of 3 months. If the testis has not descended by 6 months of age in a term infanct, it will remain undescended.Infertility and testicular malignancy are associated with undescended testes. The risk of testicular malignancy is thought to be 4-10 times higher in patients with a history of an undescended testis, and higher sill in those with bilateral undescended testes, compared to the general male population. Orchiopexy does not reduce the risk of testicular cancer, which peaks between 15 and 45 years of age. Hormonal treatment with LH-RH of hCG, used in Europe, has not been shown to be effective in randomized, controlled trials. Orchiopexy between 9 and 15 months is the recommended treatment for undescended testes.

The routine physical examination, including an orthopedic evaluation, is unremarkable. Speech and other developmental landmarks seem normal for his age. Which one of the following would be most appropriate? ",A TSH level,Random urine for aminoaciduria,Phenylketonuria screening,A serum creatinine kinase level,Chromosome analysis,,4,"The diagnosis of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, the most common neuromuscular disorder of childhood, is usually not made until the affected individual presents with an established gait abnormally at age 4-5. By then, the parents unaware of the X-linked inheritance may have had additional children who would also be at risk.The disease can be diagnosed earlier by testing for elevated creatine kinase in boys who are slow to walk. The mean age for walking in affected boys is 17.2 months, whereas over 75% of normal children walk by 13.5 months. Massive elevation of creatine kinase (CK) from 20 to 100 times normal occurs in every young infant with the disease. Early detection allows appropriate genetic counselling regarding future pregnancies.Hypothyroidism and phenylketonuria could present as delayed walking. However, these diseases cause significant mental retardation and would be associated with global developmental delay. Furthermore, these disorders are now diagnosed in the neonatal period by routine screening. Disorders of amino acid metabolism present in the newborn period with failure to thrive, poor feeding, and lethargy. Gross chromosomal abnormalities would usually be incompatible with a normal physical examination at 18 months.",,
1735,3,PMCH,You regularly volunteer your professional services to a free clinic in an underserved community in a large Canadian city where various infectious diseases are prevalent. You are helping the staff develop some recommendations regarding infectious diseases that place infants at risk during breastfeeding. Which material infectious disease listed below should be included as an absolute contraindication to breastfeeding in otherwise healthy infants. ,Hepatitis A virus infection,Cytomegalovirus infection,Tuberculosis,The common cold,HIV infection,,5,"HIV and HTLV  1 (human T-cell lymphotropic virus) infections are the only infectious diseases that are considered absolute contraindications to breastfeeding in developed countries such as Canada. The other infections listed may require temporary insolation of the baby from the mother, prophylactic treatment, or immunization of the baby and/or feeding pumped breast milk, but none are absolute contraindications to breastfeeding. For example, if the diagnosis of maternal hepatitis A is made within the period of contagiousness (approximately 3 weeks), careful handwashing by the mother is appropriate, and the infant can receive immunoglobulin and hepatitis A virus vaccination. Studies have shown that in full-term, healthy infants, acquisition of cytomegalovirus from breast milk does not result in significant clinical disease and is considered natural vaccination. Since breast milk does not contain tubercle bacilli, mothers with active tuberculosis may pump their milk to be bottle-fed to the infant by another person. For some common infections, such as the common cold, infants have already been exposed by maternal contact during the prodomal period, and interrupting breastfeeding would be counterproductive given that it provides the infant with antibodies and other anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating substances.",,

He says he has a history of mild high blood pressure but has never been treated for this. His blood pressure today is 180/90 mm Hg. He has a decreased arteriovenous ratio on fundoscopic examination, his point of maximal intensity is displaced laterally, and he has decreased pedal pulses. The most appropriate management at this point would be to:  ",Perform two blood pressure measurements 1 week apart to establish the diagnosis of hypertension,Order ambulatory blood pressure monitoring,Order a laboratory workup to rule out causes of secondary hypertension,Order an exercise stress test,Prescribe a diuretic,,5,"Elevated blood pressure along with physical findings of cardiovascular disease establishes the diagnosis of hypertension in this patient, so it is not necessary to take follow-up blood pressure readings prior to starting treatment. Since he has no symptoms or physical findings suggestive of secondary hypertension it is also not necessary to perform a laboratory workup prior to treatment. Because he has Stage 3 hypertension with evidence of end-organ disease, treatment with antihypertensives is indicated at this point.At least three large clinical trials, including the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly (EWPHE) trial, have shown that diuretics are the most effective single agents for hypertension in the elderly. A low-sodium diet can be added, as can a -blocker if the hypertension fails to respond to diuretics alone.",,

This started at the same time as her menses and coincided with a major examination in a college class she is taking. Her review of symptoms is otherwise negative. Her past medical history includes a recent acute onset of low back pain related to lifting, and a recent depressive episode which responded well to medication. Her current medications include an oral contraceptive which she has taken for 2 years, a corticosteroid nasal spray, and ibuprofen for the past 2 weeks. She was on paroxetine (Paxil), 30 mg/day, for 7 months, but this was stopped 5 days ago because of sexual dysfunction. Because of her symptoms she has not taken any medications for the past 2 days. Since then the headache has eased substantially, but the feeling of lightheadedness has remained. A physical examination is unremarkable. Which one of the following is the most likely cause of her symptoms? ",Allergic rhinitis,Paroxetine withdrawal,Serotonin syndrome,Viral infection,Stress,,2,"The timing of the symptoms (starting about 2 days after paroxetine was stopped) and the symptoms (headache, light-headedness) are consistent with SSRI discontinuation syndrome. This syndrome is more likely with abrupt withdrawal, after prolonged treatment, at higher doses.",,
1739,2,OBGYN,"A 73 year old white female presents to the office with her daughter. She complains of a several-year history of intermittent involuntary loss of urine which is gradually worsening. She frequently loses small amounts of urine when she rises from a low chair, and greater amounts if she coughs, sneezes, or laughs. She has taken to wearing absorbent undergarments and admits to significant embarrassment and limitation of activities as a result of her problem. Her daughter states that the patient has gradually withdrawn from her usual social contacts.Physical examination reveals a well-appearing elderly female. Her pelvic examination shows mucosal atrophy and a mild cystocele. With a full bladder, she loses a few mL of urine into a gauze pad when standing and coughing. Her post-void residual is normal. Her physical examination is otherwise normal for her age, and her urinalysis is normal. If nonpharmacologic interventions are not completely successful in the management of this patient's problem, which one of the following medications is most likely to help? ",Bethanechol (Urecholine),Flavoxate (Urispas),Hyoscyamine (Anaspaz NuLev),Pseudoephedrine,"Tolterodine (Detrol, Detrol LA)",,4,"Stress incontinence is common in older women. It occurs when the bladders internal sphincter is unable to keep the bladder neck closed against the rise in intravesicular pressure resulting from normal activities. While only small amounts of urine may be lost with each episode, the cumulative effect can severely impair a patient's quality of life.Nonpharmacologic therapy is important in the treatment of stress incontinence. Adjusted voiding intervals and pelvic floor (Kegel) exercises can be helpful, for example.The tone of the internal sphincter of the bladder is modulated through &alpha;-adrenergic receptors. Simulation of these receptors with agents such as pseudoephedrine or imipramine can increase internal sphincter tone and alleviate symptoms. Tolterodine, flavoxate, and hyoscyamne reduce bladder contractions and are potentially helpful to patients with urge incontinence from detrusor overactivity. Bethanechol is a bladder stimulant and may be helpful in patients with transient urinary retention and overflow incontinence due to decreased detrusor tone.",,

She had her first child 4 years ago, but has not been able to become pregnant since. Her physical examination and pelvic examination are unremarkable. A serum pregnancy test is negative, prolactin levels are normal, and LH and FSH levels are both three times normal on two occasions. These findings are consistent with ",Hypothalamic amenorrhea,Ovarian failure,Pituitary macroadenoma,Pituitary microadenoma,Polycystic ovarian syndrome,,2,"The history and physical findings in this patient are consistent with all of the conditions listed. However, the elevated FSH and LH indicate an ovarian problem, and this case is consistent with ovarian failure or premature menopause. Most pituitary tumors associated with amenorrhea produce hyperprolactinemia. Polycystic ovarian syndrome usually results in normal to slightly elevated LH levels and tonically low FSH levels. Hypothalamic amenorrhea is a diagnosis of exclusion, and can be induced by weight loss, excessive physical exercise (jogging, ballet), or systematic illness, and is associated with tonically low levels of LH and FSH.",,

The father has recently seen a neurologist who performed a workup for dementia and diagnosed moderate Alzheimer's disease. Which one of the following is true regarding the use of a cholinesterase inhibitor in this patient? ,It is too late to initiate cholinesterase therapy,Agitation is often intensified by these agents,Memory is likely to improve significantly,If the patient has a vascular dementia rather than Alzheimer's dementia the drug will not be useful,Nursing-home placement may be delayed a year or longer,,5,"Medications for dementia should be prescribed with caution, and the patient watched closely for side effects. Currently available cholinesterase inhibitors are at least as effective for vascular dementia as they are for Alzheimer's dementia, although they are not approved for this use by the FDA. These agents include donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, and they are often helpful in Alzheimer's disease patients with agitation. Anticholinesterase therapy is considered the standard of care for Alzheimer's disease, and therapy can begin at any stage in the disease process, although early therapy is the most beneficial. While the medication will not restore memory, it does prevent the rapid loss of more memory. Long-term studies on effectiveness are still in progress, but most evidence at present indicates that nursing-home placement can be delayed by a year and possibly longer.",,

There is inadequate fixation of the testis within the scrotum, resulting in excessive mobility. Shortly after torsion, there is acute pain and swelling of the scrotum, which is very tender. The normal cremasteric reflex is nearly always absent. The differential diagnosis includes strangulated inguinal hernia, which most often causes inguinal swelling, unlike torsion. There is no antecedent association of hydrocele with testicular torsion.Spermatogenesis can be lost within 6 hours of the loss of blood flow, making prompt diagnosis and surgical detorsion and fixation essential. Either a 99mTc-Pertechnetate flow scan of colour Doppler ultrasonography is about 95% accurate in determining flow, but results can be misleading if torsion is less that 360.

Elderly widowers are in the highest risk group. Several features of this case, including the long-term inattention to self, gaze disturbance, cerebellar signs, confabulation (confidence in the face of confusion), and better past that present memory, all suggest Wernicke's encephalopathy. The presence of signs of wet beriberi related to the same nutritional deficiency support the diagnosis. The patient is at immediate risk and thiamine should be administered right away. Other diagnosis are less likely.

The most probable primary diagnosis in this patient is which one of the following? ",Acute stress disorder,Adjustment reaction with depressed mood,Major depression,Generalized anxiety disorder,Post-traumatic stress disorder,,5,"This patient's findings include all four categories of criteria for the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). First, a traumatic event occurred in which the patient witnessed or experienced actual or threatened death or serious injury and responded with intense fear, horror, or helplessness. Second, on exposure to memory cues, the patient has re-experiencing symptoms such as intrusive recollections, nightmares, flashbacks, or psychological distress. Third, the patient avoids trauma-related stimuli and feels emotionally numb. Finally, the patient has increased arousal, manifested by hypervigilance, irritability, or difficulty sleeping. The symptoms must also be persistent for at least 1 month and significantly disturb the patients social or occupational functioning, or both.Acute stress disorder also occurs after exposure to a traumatic event, but symptoms appear within 4 weeks of the trauma and last from 2 days to 4 weeks. Patients with this disorder also have more dissociative symptoms, describing themselves as feeling &ldquo;in a daze&rdquo; or having temporary amnesia about the event. PTSD increases the risk of later developing comorbid psychiatric problems.

Abnormally high levels must be confirmed by immediate repeat measurement. The next step is level I ultrasonography to rule out other conditions which can result in elevated levels, such as multiple gestation, incorrect gestational age or fetal demise. More detailed level II ultrasonography and amniocentesis are then performed if the initial results are normal and confirm fetal age. An open neural tube defect is found within only 2%-3% of positive maternal serum tests. Therefore, recommendations for termination of the pregnancy should be made only after confirmation of a problem by ultrasonography and amniocentesis. The significance of -fetoprotein levels after 22 weeks gestation is unknown.

The patient may have fleeting thoughts of suicide and likely will express worry about separation from loved ones. This usually responds to counselling.In patients with anhedonia, persistent dysphoria, disturbed self-image, hopelessness, poor sense of self-worth, rumination about death and suicide, or an active desire for early death, depression is the problem. For patients who are expected to live only a few days, psychostimulants such as methylphenidate should be used. For those who are expected to survive longer, SSRIs are a good choice.",,
1764,2,OBGYN,A 24 year old white female contracts a primary genital herpes virus infection during her 25th week of gestation. Which one of the following statements is true? ,She has a high likelihood of miscarriage,She should be treated with antiviral therapy for 7-14 days,She should be scheduled for cesarean section at term,She should be advised against breastfeeding her infant,,,2,"Most women who develop primary herpes virus (HSV) infection during pregnancy will deliver healthy babies. Studies have not shown increased rates of miscarriage, especially after the first trimester. Current guidelines recommend treatment with antiviral agents for primary HSV infection in pregnancy. Caesarean section is not routinely recommended if a woman has had an infection during pregnancy unless active viral lesions are present at the time of delivery. Breastfeeding is unlikely to lead to neonatal infection.",,
1765,5,Psychiatry,"You are treating a 34 year old white male for anxiety, panic disorder, and a history of alcoholism. He has been abstinent from alcohol for 6 years. Which one of the following treatment options carries the greatest risk of physical dependence? ",Alprazolam (Xanax),Imipramine (Tofranil),Buspirone (BuSpar),Propranolol (Inderal),Phenelzine (Nardil),,1,"Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine. It is capable of producing physical dependence, and the risk is substantially elevated in a patient with a history of alcohol dependence.Imipramine is a tricyclic drug and does not carry a risk of physical addiction or dependence. Buspirone is in the azapirone class. It does not produce sedation or euphoria. There is no withdrawal syndrome or dependence. Propranolol is a beta-blocker and may be useful for controlling somatic symptoms of anxiety. While Beta-blockers are not addictive, abrupt withdrawal may be hazardous due to potential cardiovascular side effects. Phenelzine is an MAO inhibitor. Physical dependence is not a problem with this drug class.",,

Which treatment has been shown to be of the most benefit initially? ,Complete bed rest for 2 weeks,Bed rest plus local injection of steroids,A low back strengthening program,Resumption of physical activity as tolerated,,,4,"Recent studies have shown superior benefits to allowing patients with acute low back pain, without sciatic involvement, to return to normal activities as tolerated. This was better than either bed rest or a back exercise program. Injections would be considered only if conservative therapy fails.",,
1767,6,Surgery,"While performing a vasectomy on a 33 year old male, you are unable to definitely identify the left vas deferens. You take some time to try and find the vas, but the patient is becoming very uncomfortable. You can easily isolate the right vas. The patient has fathered three children and has no difficulty with erectile function. The examination of his external genitalia was normal. What should you do next? ",Recommend that you try to find the left vas deferens under general anesthesia,Abandon the attempt at vasectomy and recommend a tubal ligation for his wife,Make a large scrotal incision and continue to try to find the left vas deferens,Ligate the right vas deferens and check a semen specimen in 6 weeks,,,4,"If a vas cannot be located by an experienced surgeon, the possibility of congenital absence of the vas must be considered. This is usually associated with agenesis of the ipsilateral kidney. The vas which can be palpated should be ligated, and a semen specimen checked at the usual time.",,
1768,5,Psychiatry,Which one of the following is the medical treatment of choice for acute delirium in the intensive care unit?,Intravenous haloperidol (Haldol) in increasing doses every 30 minutes as needed,Intravenous droperidol (Inapsine) every 6-8 hours,Intravenous lorazepam (Ativan),Intramuscular chlorpromazine (Thorazine),Intramuscular diphenhydramine (Benadryl),,1,Intravenous haloperidol has been found to be more effective than lorazepam and has minimal physiologic side effects. Chlorpromazine can worsen confusion and lower blood pressure. Droperidol can cause akathisia. Diphenhydramine can increase confusion due to its anticholinergic effects.,,

1773,1,Medicine,The tumor marker most closely associated with ovarian cancer is: ,CA-125,Carcinoembryonic antigen,CA 19-9,CD25,Alpha-fetoprotein,,1,"The workup of a patient with suspected ovarian cancer includes checking serum levels of the tumor marker CA-125. While it can be elevated in some other malignancies, and even some nonmalignant gynecologic conditions, the CA-125 marker is most closely associated with ovarian cancer. It is not useful as a screening tool because many women with early (stage I or II) ovarian cancer have normal CA-125 levels.CEA is most commonly used to follow colon cancer, while AFP is a marker for hepatocellular carcinoma. CA 19-9 is elevated in pancreatic, colon, and breast cancer. CD25 is a marker for certain leukemias.",,

On examination, deep tendon reflexes in his legs are 0 to 1+ bilaterally. He has mild muscle weakness of his quadriceps and 1+ pedal pulses. He is taking ibuprofen, 800 mg three times a day, and using a back brace without much relief. Which one of the following would be most likely to relieve his symptoms? ",Sympathectomy,Aortofemoral bypass,Trigger-point corticosteroid injections,Posterior spinal decompression surgery,Systemic oral corticosteroids,,4,"This patient's symptoms are typical of spinal stenosis, as they are present when he is standing and relieved by sitting. He has already failed a trial of NSAIDs and bracing. Spinal decompression surgery is now indicated. Epidural corticosteroid injection might be helpful, but not trigger-point injections. Oral corticosteroids would be helpful if he had a herniated disc. Sympathectomy and bypass surgery are treatments for vascular occlusion.",,

This decreased incidence has also dramatically reduced morbidity and mortality.,,
1777,2,OBGYN,A 30 year old white primigravida asks you about the benefits and drawbacks of corticosteroid therapy for premature labor at 30 weeks gestation. Which one of the following statements is most accurate? ,Therapy will decrease the risk of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis,Weekly corticosteroid injections until 34 weeks gestation is the standard regimen to prevent respiratory distress syndrome,Therapy is associated with a higher rate of neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage,Therapy is associated with a higher rate of persistent patent ductus arteriosus,Therapy decreases the risk of respiratory distress syndrome but not total neonatal mortality,,1,Treatment of premature labor with betamethasone or dexamethasone has been associated with up to a 65% reduction in necrotizing enterocolitis in the neonate. Weekly treatment is not generally accepted. Increasing reports of adverse consequences with repeated courses of treatment has caused most experts to recommend a single course of antenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth at 24-34 weeks gestation.Reported benefits of antenatal steroid therapy for preterm labor include reduced rates of intraventricular hemorrhage and persistent patent ductus arteriosus. Both neonatal mortality and the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome are also reduced.,,

He also admits that he sometimes chokes on food, and that his wife says he has bad breath. The most likely diagnosis is: ",Achalasia,Esophageal reflux,Cancer of esophagus,Zenker's diverticulum,Large cervical bone spur,,4,"The combination of halitosis, late regurgitation of undigested food, and choking suggests Zenker's diverticulum. Patients may also have dysphagia and weight loss. The diagnosis is usually made with a barium swallow. The treatment is surgical.",,

These include anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, constipation), orthostatic hypotension, cardiac conduction disturbances, and drowsiness. Loss of appetite is often seen in patients who take fluoxetine, and can be especially troublesome in the elderly. Skin rash is uncommon.",,
1781,4,Pediatrics,"A healthy 8 month old white male has suddenly developed recurrent bouts of what appears to be severe abdominal pain. He cries inconsolably and draws up his legs, but does not seem ill between episodes. He has vomited and on examination has a small amount of bloody mucoid stool in his diaper and palpable mass in his undistended right upper abdomen. The most likely diagnosis is: ",Intussusception,Pyloric stenosis,Duodenal atresia,Meckel's diverticulum,Gastroschisis,,1,"This case presentation is fairly typical for intussusception, the &ldquo;telescoping&rdquo; of a portion of the intestine into itself with obstruction and crampy pain. it generally occurs between the ages of 6 months and 24 months. A sausage-shaped mass is often palpable as a result of the ileum being trapped within the colon. The presence of bloody mucus supports the diagnosis.Pyloric stenosis generally occurs in the first 4-6 weeks of life (although it can occur as late as the fifth month) with a striking first-born male predominance. Emesis is the most prominent feature of pyloric stenosis; it is usually painless, and there are no bloody stools. The small pyloric mass, which feels like an olive, may be palpable at the margin of the right rectus muscle. The onset is more insidious than with intussuscpetion. Duodenal atresia presents shortly after birth with vomiting and a &ldquo;double-bubble&rdquo; on radiograph, indicating a gas-filled stomach and proximal duodenum. A Meckel's diverticulum may rarely be found at the lead point of an intussusception, but it usually presents as a cause of recurrent abdominal pain in later life. Gastroschisis is an antenatal evisceration through a small paraumbilical defect that is present at birth.",,

The most likely diagnosis is: ",Crohn's disease (regional enteritis),Ulcerative colitis,Amebic colitis,Diverticulitis,Lymphoma,,1,"When Crohn's disease affects primarily the distal small intestine (regional enteritis), a most characteristic clinical pattern emerges. A young person, usually in the second or third decade, will present with a period of episodic abdominal pain, largely postprandial and often periumbilical, occasionally with low-grade fever and mild diarrhea.Anorexia, nausea, and vomiting may also be present. Weight loss is frequent. Some patients may be aware of tenderness in the right lower quadrant and even of a palpable mass in that region.",,

Physical examination is normal except for a thin, homogenous discharge, with no significant cervical or vaginal inflammation. A wet-mount preparation of the discharge reveals numerous epithelial cells coated with small non-motile organisms. A KOH preparation is negative but has a &ldquo;fishy&rdquo; odor. Which one of the following is correct regarding this patient's condition? ",Failure to treat the male partner may result in urethritis or prostatitis,Symptomatic relief of the infection frequently requires several courses of treatment in patients taking oral contraceptives,The infection should be reported to local health authorities for contact tracking,This infection can be treated with oral or vaginal clindamycin (Cleocin),,,4,The patient described has a classic case of bacterial vaginosis.

",He may participate in noncontact sports,Cardiac catheterization should be performed immediately.,His condition usually decreases lifespan,His hypertrophy will regress with age,His siblings should undergo echocardiography,,5,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an autosomal dominant condition and close relatives of affected individuals should be screened (with echocardiography). The hypertrophy usually stays the same or worsens with age. This patient should not participate in strenuous sports, even those considered noncontact. The mortality rate is believed to be about 1%, with some series estimating 5%. Thus, in most cases, lifespan is normal.

Which one of the following is the most appropriate treatment option? ",Amoxicillin,Azithromycin (Zithromax),Doxycycline,Erythromycin,,,1,"Amoxicillin is preferred for the treatment of Lyme disease in children, as well as for pregnant or lactating women. Doxycycline is effective, but should not be used in pregnant women. Macrolides are not considered first-line agents because controlled trails of azithromycin or erythromycin in patients with erthema migrans found a high rate of clinical failure.",,

Thus, the patient with HIV may be vaccinated with the killed DtaP vaccine, while the patient with lymphoma may not be vaccinated with the varicella vaccine. Persons with a history of anaphylactic or anaphylactic-like allergy to eggs or egg proteins should not be given vaccine prepared using embryonated chicken eggs, such as influenza vaccine.Although no cases of congenital rubella or abnormalities attributable to fetal infection have been observed among infants born to susceptible women who received rubella vaccine during pregnancy, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommend that women avoid becoming pregnant during the 4 weeks following immunization. The rubella vaccine is grown in human diploid cell cultures and can be safely administered to persons with a history of severe allergy to egg and egg proteins. The rare serious allergic reactions after MMR are not believed to be caused by egg antigens, but to other components of the vaccine, such as gelatin. MMR and its component vaccines, as well as some other vaccines, contain hydrolyzed gelatin as a stabilizer. Extreme caution should be exercised when administering vaccines that contain gelatin to persons who have a history of an anaphylactic reaction to gelatin or gelatin-containing products.",,

1791,1,Medicine,"A 62 year old white male comes to your office with pain and swelling of the left great toe at the metatarsophalangeal joint. Examination shows it is erythematous, warm, swollen, and tender to touch. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus controlled by diet, and hypertension. His medications include hydrochlorothiazide, 25 mg/day. A CBC and blood chemistry profile are normal, except for a uric acid level of 9.2 mg/dL (N 3.6-8.5). Which one of the following is true in this situation? ",This attack should resolve spontaneously in 3-4 days,Allopurinol (Zyloprim) therapy should be started,The elevated uric acid level establishes the diagnosis of gout,Intra-articular steroid injection should be avoided,Stopping the hydrochlorothiazide may control the hyperuricemia,,5,"This is a typical presentation for gout. Elevated uric acid levels are not necessary for the diagnosis, as there are some patients with normal uric acid levels who still have gout. Conversely, hyperuricemia does not establish the diagnosis of gout. Risk factors for the development of gout include several enzyme deficiencies, renal insufficiency, hypertension, obesity, moonshine ingestion (causing lead exposure), and alcohol abuse. There are several medications that elevate uric acid, including diuretics, low-dose salicylates, niacin, cyclosporine, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide.A typical gout attack such as the one described will resolve spontaneously within 2 weeks without treatment. In patients who have an acute monoarticular arthritis in addition to gout, other diagnoses such as osteoarthritis, pseudogout, and infection must be considered. The diagnosis of gout is established by aspiration of synovial fluid or tophi, with characteristic uric acid crystals detected by polarized light microscopy. Treatment can consist of NSAIDs in healthy individuals. Indomethacin is considered the drug of choice. Corticosteroids can also be used, and are particularly helpful when the patient has renal insufficiency. Intra-articular injections of a corticosteroid such as triamcinolone are useful, and intramuscular corticosteroids may be especially useful in patients with polyarticular gout. Colchicine may be used, but may cause diarrhea. Life style changes such as weight loss, discontinuing alcohol use, and changing antihypertensive therapy is often all that is needed to control the hyperuricemia and thus prevent further attacks. Colchicine can be used for prophylaxis as well, although it does not alter hyperuricemia or prevent tophi from forming. If a patient has more than two attacks per year, urate chlorine therapy is indicated. A 24-hour urine collection to identify whether the patient is an under-excretor or an overproducer of uric acid would indicate the correct medication. Overproducers are treated with allopurinol, while under-excretors benefit from probenecid if renal function is normal and there is no history of kidney stones.",,

The short-term risk of stroke is high among patients with severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery. Although data is lacking on the optimal timing of endarterectomy, when infarction is absent or limited, urgent endarterecetomy is probably indicated for patients with internal carotid artery stenosis of 70%-99% and in selected patients with stenosis of 50%-69% who can be treated surgically with a low risk of complications.",,

1796,2,OBGYN,A 21 year old married gravida 1 para 1 has not used her oral contraceptives for 6 months. She comes to your office for evaluation because her menstrual period is 2 weeks late. Her menses had been regular since discontinuing the oral contraceptives. A urine hCG is negative. Which one of the following is true regarding this situation? ,It is unlikely that she is pregnant,Pregnancy cannot be diagnosed before the first missed menstrual period,A serum progesterone level should be drawn,Transvaginal ultrasonography should be performed,,,1,"With the high level of sensitivity and specificity of current tests to measure hCG in serum and urine, pregnancy can now be diagnosed before the time of the first missed menstrual period. For current serum hCG assays, the low threshold for detection is 10-25 IU/L, while for urine assays it is 25-50 IU/L, which corresponds to approximately the seventh day after conception. Because the levels of hCG in the blood and urine are very similar, the tests are equivalent. Urine testing may reveal a positive result as early as 3-4 days after implantation. By the time of the expected menstrual period, the test will be positive 98% of the time. If a test is negative more than 1 week after the expected time of the menstrual period, it is almost certain the patient is not pregnant. To cover these rare instances where a woman has a low hCG and conceived later than expected, the test should be repeated in 1 week for a definitive result.Since ectopic pregnancy is not a life-threatening problem for the mother until 2 months after conception, a patient with a negative urine hCG does not require ultrasonography to exclude ectopic pregnancy. Patients with a suspected ectopic pregnancy and a negative urine hCG should be followed closely, as early laparoscopic intervention can improve the chances of future fertility.",,

1800,4,Pediatrics,"During a routine well child examination of a 9 month old female, you discover labial adhesions with a 5-mm opening anteriorly. Which one of the following statements is true concerning this condition? ",It is rarely found in neonates,It is rarely associated with urinary tract infections,The labia majora are most likely affected,Surgery is the treatment of choice,Oral estrogens are an accepted alternate treatment,,1,"The exact cause of labial adhesions is unknown. However, since it rarely occurs in neonates and responds to estrogen therapy, a hypoestrogenic state is felt to be a contributing factor. The lesion results from fusion of the labia minora. There is a 20%-40% incidence of recurrent urinary tract infections in these patients. The treatment of choice is 2-8 weeks of local treatment with estrogen cream. Oral estrogens are not indicated and may cause a harmful hyperestrogenic state, with female virilization features. Because of the possibility of pain, recurrence, and potential scarring, surgical treatment is recommended only if medical treatment is unsuccessful.",,

The ultrasound components include fetal breathing movements, gross body movements, fetal tone, and a qualitative assessment of amniotic fluid volume. This test is commonly done after 28 weeks gestation (after which fetal viability is likely) and can be used to assess fetal well-being in patients with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) or other high-risk pregnancies.The test is performed at varying frequencies depending upon the obstetric or fetal risk level. A normal score (10/10) is reliable evidence of fetal well-being at the time of the test and that fetal demise is unlikely in the following 7 days. Lower scores have variable interpretations, depending on the clinical circumstances. For example, a score of 8/10 with low amniotic fluid volume may indicate a risk for acute decompensation. Adequate amniotic fluid is defined as one of more pockets of fluid  2 cm in vertical diameter.",,

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 200 patients who were undergoing elective noncardiac surgery that required general anesthesia, the effect of atenolol on perioperative cardiac complications was evaluated.Patients were eligible for Beta-blocker therapy if they had known coronary artery disease or two or more risk factors. Atenolol was not used if the resting heart rate was  55 beats/min, systolic blood pressure was  100 mm Hg, or there was evidence of congestive heart failure, third degree heart block, or bronchospasm. A 5-mg dose of intravenous atenolol was given 30 minutes before surgery and then again immediately after surgery. Oral atenolol, 50-100 mg, was given until hospital discharge or 7 days postoperatively.

1814,4,Pediatrics,A 10 year old white male is brought to your office with a chief complaint of head congestion associated with moderate malaise and a low-grade fever for 7 days. He has had a thick discolored nasal discharge for the last 2 days. Which one of the following is correct regarding his management? ,Amoxicillin should be prescribed,Erythromycin should be prescribed,No antibiotics should be used at this time,"Sinus radiographs should be ordered, and the decision to use antibiotics should be based on the findings",,,3,"Clinical diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis requires the following: prolonged nonspecific upper respiratory signs and symptoms (i.e., rhinosinusitis and cough without improvement for  10-14 days), or more severe upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms (i.e., fever 39C, facial swelling, and facial pain). This individual does not meet these criteria, so antibiotics should not be used at this time. Although some believe that mucopurulent rhinitis (thick, opaque, or discolored nasal discharge) indicates the presence of bacterial sinusitis, this sign should be recognized as part of the natural course of a nonspecific, uncomplicated viral upper respiratory infection (URI). Sinus radiographs can demonstrate thickened mucosa, infundibular occlusion, and occasional air-fluid levels in uncomplicated viral URI.",,
1815,1,Medicine,"An otherwise healthy 72 year old white male presents with pain on the right side of his head, increasing in severity over the past 2 days. Today he broke out in a rash consisting of grouped vesicles on an erythematous base in the distribution of the first division of the fifth cranial nerve.

",Intravenous acyclovir (Zovirax),Oral famciclovir (Famvir),Topical capsaicin (Zostrix),Varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG),Idoxuridine (Herplex) eye drops,,2,"Herpes zoster, or shingles, is a common condition which results from the reactivation of varicella virus acquired during an earlier episode of chickenpox. The distribution of the characteristic rash typically follows a single dermatome and does not cross the midline. The lesions are typically painful, and postherpetic neuralgia can become a disabling chronic problem. When any branch of the ophthalmic nerve is involved, the condition is called herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Vesicles on the side or tip of the nose (Hutchison's sign) that occur during an episode of zoster suggest involvement of the nasociliary branch, and are associated with the most serious ocular complications. Involvement of the other sensory branches of the trigeminal nerve may affect the eyelid but rarely involves the eye itself.Treatment of uncomplicated herpes zoster ophthalmicus in an immunocompetent patient includes oral acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir. Corticosteroids can be used for acute pain but have no effect on the development of postherpetic neuralgia.Intravenous antiviral therapy is indicated for immunosuppressed patients with extensive cutaneous disease, and those at high risk for ocular complications. Treatment is most effective when started within 48 hours of the onset of the disease.Capsaicin cream is used in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia, and varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) is used in high-risk immunocompromised patients to prevent varicella infection. Idoxuridine is indicated for herpes simplex keratitis.",,

Which one of the following would be appropriate advice? ,Prophylactic oophorectomy should be performed as soon as possible,Surgery can be safely delayed until her family is complete,Oophorecetomy will increase her risk of breast cancer,Surveillance measures including CA-125 levels and ultrasonography will improve her prognosis,Oral contraceptives are highly effective for delaying disease,,2,"Women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations are at increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer. Prophylactic oophorectomy is often advised to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer. A recent study has shown that oophorectomy reduces the risk of both ovarian cancer and breast cancer in women with these mutations. The mean age at diagnosis of ovarian cancer in this study was over 50 years, indicating that oophorectomy can usually be delayed until childbearing is complete. Surveillance has not been shown to reduce the proportion of ovarian cancer diagnosed in late stages or to have any effect on mortality. Studies have shown little benefit from oral contraceptive use in terms of ovarian cancer prevention.",,

Length-time bias is when a screening test finds a disproportionate number of cases of slowly progressive disease and misses the aggressive cases, thereby leading to an overestimate of the effectiveness of the screening. A false-positive test is one that suggests cancer where no cancer exists. The positive predictive value is the proportion of positive test results that are true positives.

She complains of pain over the distal anterior talofibular ligament, but is able to bear weight. There is mild swelling, mild black and blue discoloration, and moderate tenderness to palpitation over the insertion of the anterior talofibular ligament, but the malleoli are nontender to palpitation. Which one of the following statements is true regarding the management of this case? ","Anteroposterior, lateral, and 30 internal oblique (mortise view) radiographs should be done to rule out fracture",Stress radiographs will be needed to rule out a major partial or complete ligamentous tear,The patient should use crutches and avoid weight bearing for 10-14 days,Early range-of-motion exercises should be initiated to maintain flexibility,"For best results, functional rehabilitation should begin within the first 24 hours after injury",,4,"This patient has an uncomplicated lateral ankle sprain and requires minimal intervention. The Ottawa ankle rules were developed to determine when radiographs are needed for ankle sprains. In summary, ankle radiographs should be done if the patient has pain at the medial or lateral malleolus and either bone tenderness at the back edge or tip of the lateral or medial malleolus, or an inability to bear weight immediately after the injury or in the emergency department, or both. If the patient complains of midfoot pain and/or bone tenderness at the base of the fifth metatarsal or navicular, or an inability to bear weight, radiographs should be ordered.Sprains can be differentiated from major partial or complete ligamentous tears by anteroposterior, lateral, and 30 internal oblique (mortise view) radiographs. If the joint cleft between either malleolus and the talus is 4 mm, a major ligamentous tear is probable. Stress radiographs in forced inversion are sometimes helpful to demonstrate stability, but ankle instability can be present with a normal stress radiograph.Grade I and II ankle sprains are best treated with RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation) and an air splint for ambulation. NSAIDs are used for control of pain and inflammation. Heat should be applied. Early range-of-motion exercises should be initiated to maintain flexibility. Weight bearing is appropriate as tolerated and functional rehabilitation should be started when pain permits. Exercises on a balance board will help develop coordination.",,

As patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis have a dismal prognosis without treatment, prompt correction of his mechanical obstruction with aortic valve replacement is indicated. Medical management is not effective, and balloon valvotomy only temporarily relieves the symptoms and does not prolong survival. Patients who present with dyspnea have only a 50% chance of being alive in 2 years unless the valve is promptly replaced.

1834,3,PMCH,An 84 year old white female presents to your office with symptoms of an upper respiratory infection and a hacking cough. She admits to smoking one pack of cigarettes daily since she was 21 years of age. Which one of the following is true with regard to her tobacco use? ,"If she is unable to quit smoking she should switch to a low-tar, low-nicotine cigarette",Individuals this age do not benefit from smoking cessation,Nicotine patches should not be used if she has coexisting coronary artery disease,Sustained-release bupropion (Wellbutrin SR) has been shown to reduce the relapse rate for up to 12 months,,,4,"Sustained-release bupropion has been shown to reduce the relapse rate for smoking cessation and blunt weight gain for 12 months. Beneficial effects of smoking cessation are seen even among older smokers. Evidence has now shown that smokers who switch to low-tar or low-nicotine cigarettes do not significantly decrease their health risks. The approved Food and Drug Administration medications for smoking cessation (sustained-release bupropion, nicotine patch, nicotine gum, nicotine inhaler, and nicotine nasal spray) have been shown to be safe and should be recommended for all patients without contraindications who are trying to quit smoking. The nicotine patch in particular is safe, and has been shown not too cause adverse cardiovascular effects.",,
1835,2,OBGYN,"A 29 year old gravida 0 para 0 presents to your office with a chief complaint of irregular infrequent menses. Over the past few years, she has noted increasing dark hair growth on her chin and above her upper lip. On examination, she is normotensive and moderately overweight. Examination of the skin reveals acne and abdominal striae. The remainder of the examination is normal.Laboratory Findings:TSH 2.1 U/mL (N 0.3-5.0)FSH 8 U/L (N 1-10)LH 38 U/L (N 1-20)Free testosterone 50 ng/dL (N 0.3-1.9)Prolactin 28 ng/mL (N 0-23)17 hydroxyprogesterone 4 ng/dL (N 0-8)DHEA-S (dehydroepiandrosterone 2.0 &#61549;g/dL (N 0-3.0)sulfate)In addition, a dexamethasone suppression test was normal. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this patient? ",Cushing's syndrome,Polycystic ovarian syndrome,Virilizing adrenal tumor,Prolactinoma,Adult-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia,,2,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a very heterogenrous syndrome, but is often characterized by signs and symptoms of androgen excess and chronic anovulation (menstrual irregularity, oligo- or amenorrhea). Hirsutism and acne are common presenting signs of hyperandrogenism. Seventy percent of patients are obese, and hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are common. LH is usually elevated, but an LH:FSH ratio of 3:1 or greater is a better indicator of PCOS. The FSH is usually normal or mildly low. Serum testosterone and prolactin are often mildly to moderately elevated. DHEA-S levels are normal in PCOS. Fasting insulin levels may be high and these patients should be screened for overt diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance, and hyperlipidemia.Patients with Cushing's syndrome and adult-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) may also present with hirsutism, acne, and menstrual abnormalities. However, in this patient a normal dexamethasone suppression test makes Cushing's syndrome an unlikely diagnosis. 17 hydroxyprogesterone (17 OHP) is a screening test for adult-onset CAH. CAH patients may also have an elevated LH. In contrast, 17 OHP levels are normal in women with PCOS.A virilizing adrenal tumor is very unlikely unless mean testosterone measurements are markedly elevated (&gt;150-200 ng/dL). In addition, DHEA-S level s are usually very high (&gt; 700 g/dL). The clinical syndrome usually presents with rapidly progressive hirsutism.Lastly, serum prolactin levels are usually very high in women with prolactinomas ( &gt; 200 ng/mL). These patients may present with signs of androgen excess and menstrual irregularity, as well as headache, visual disturbance, and galactorrhea.",,
1836,5,Psychiatry,"You see a 32 year old white female for her first visit. She presents with numerous complaints which do not conform to patterns seen in organic disease. She states that she has seen several physicians and describes a changing set of symptoms. Although she appears to be well, she claims to have been &ldquo;sickly&rdquo; for years. From her affect, you suspect that she is depressed. The most likely diagnosis is ",Conversion reaction,Chronic somatization disorder,Schizophrenia with multiple somatic delusions,Histrionic personality,Primary hypochondriasis,,2,"Conversion disorder usually involves a single symptom which is neurologic or pain-related. Symptoms of chronic somatization differ from psychoses in that the symptoms of the psychotic patient are bizarre and more vivid, persist over time, are unaltered by reasoned argument, and are not congruent with the patient's social or cultural background. The delusional nature of psychotic somatic symptoms usually unfolds as the patient talks.The essential feature of the histrionic (hysterical) personality is a pervasive pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking. People with this disorder constantly seek to be the center of attention. Emotions are often expressed with inappropriate exaggeration. People with this disorder tend the be very self-centered and have little tolerance for delayed gratification. These people are typically attractive and seductive, often to the point of looking flamboyant and acting inappropriately.Features of primary hypochondriasis include the patient's fixed conviction that he or she is ill, the interpretation of all somatic changes as confirmation of this, and a relentless pursuit of medical assistance despite persistent dissatisfaction with the results. The patient's symptoms remain consistent for years.Physicians frequently feel overwhelmed when initially presented with a patient with somatization disorder. This disorder begins before age 30 and is rarely seen in males. The patient complains of multiple symptoms which involve many organ systems and do not readily conform to patterns seen in organic diseases. The patient skips back and forth from symptom to symptom during the interview. Anxiety and depressed mood are frequent in this disorder, and suicide attempts are common.",,

The patient suffered an uncomplicated acute anterior-wall myocardial infarction approximately 18 months ago. A stress test was normal 2 months after he was discharged from the hospital. Currently, the patient feels well, walks while playing nine holes of golf three times per week, and is able to walk up a flight of stairs without chest pain or significant dyspnea. Findings are normal on a physical examination. Which one of the following would be most appropriate for this patient prior to surgery? ",A 12-lead resting EKG,A graded exercise stress test,A stress echocardiogram,A persantine stressed nuclear tracer study (technetium or thallium),Coronary angiography,,1,"The current recommendations on preoperative clearance for noncardiac surgery state that preoperative intervention is rarely needed to lower surgical risk. Patients who are not currently experiencing unstable coronary syndrome, severe valvular disease, uncompensated congestive heart failure, or a significant arrhythmia are not considered at high risk, and should be evaluated for most surgery primarily on the basis of their functional status. If these patients are capable of moderate activity without cardiac symptoms, they can be cleared with no stress testing or coronary angiography for an elective minor or intermediate-risk operation such as the one this patient is to undergo. A resting 12-lead EKG is recommended for males over 45, females over 55, and patients with diabetes, symptoms of chest pain, or a previous history of cardiac disease.",,

Her hematocrit is 34% (N 35-45) and her TSH level is 0.00 U/mL (N 0.5-5.0). Which one of the following would be most appropriate at this time? ",Propylthiouracil,Propylthiouracil plus levothyroxine (Synthroid),Methimazole (Tapazole),Radioactive iodine therapy,Immediate surgery,,1,"There is a 5%-10% recurrence rate for Graves' disease after treatment with radioactive iodine. Years may pass before recurrence. Radioactive iodine therapy is contraindicated in pregnancy, and immediate surgery might present hazards to both the mother and the fetus. Propranolol would control the patient's heart rate, but would do nothing about the underlying hyperthyroidism.Propylthiorucail has been used extensively in pregnancy and has never been shown to have any teratogenic effect. The combination of propylthiouracil and levothyroxine is frequently used for hyperthyroidism in nonpregnant patients, but transplacental passage of the levothyroxine would be harmful to the developing fetus. Methimazole crosses the placenta more readily than propylthiouracil and is associated with aplasia cutis.",,

1841,1,Medicine,"A 39 year old white male comes to your office with severe pain, fluctuance, erythema, and tenderness localized over the tip of the distal middle finger. The most likely diagnosis is: ",A paronychia,A felon (whitlow),An eponychial abscess,Bacterial tenosynovitis,Digital cellulitis,,2,"A felon, also called a whitlow, is an infection of the digital pulp of the terminal phalanx. The anatomic characteristics of this region compartmentalize infection, resulting in exquisite pressure and pain in the pulp spaces. As with all abscesses, incision and drainage is the single most important therapy.Paronychial and eponychial infections occur in the dorsal surface of the finger about the nail. Bacterial tenosynovitis is an extension of a deep space infection along the tendons. Digital cellulitis is a nonspecific term and does not adequately describe the infection depicted. The presence of fluctuance with this infection suggests abscess formation rather than a simple cellulitis.",,

The risk is due to immobilization, venous injury and stasis, and impairment of natural anticoagulants. For total knee replacement, hip fracture surgery, and total hip replacement, the prevalence of DVT is 40%-80%, and the prevalence of pulmonary embolism is 2%-30%. Other orthopedic procedures, such as elective spine procedures, have a much lower rate, approximately 5%. The prevalence of DVT after a coronary artery bypass graft is approximately 5%, after transurethral prostatectomy  5%, and after abdominal hysterectomy approximately 16%.",,

",Most women with breast cancer have no identifiable risk factors,Hereditary breast cancer is more common in postmeopausal women,Having several second degree relatives with breast cancer carries the same risk as having one first degree relative with breast cancer,"When hereditary breast cancer strikes several generations of a family, women descended from a male family member are not at increased risk",,,1,"Most women with breast cancer have no identifiable risk factors. The benefit of screening women over 75 is not firmly established. Hereditary breast cancer is more common in premenopausal women, and the risk is increased three- to fourfold in women with a first degree relative who has had breast cancer. Having several second degree relatives with breast cancer results in increased risk, but this risk has not been quantified. Even women with hereditary breast cancer on the paternal side are at some increased risk.",,

It has been specifically demonstrated that treatment of group B streptococcal bacteriuria decreases the rate of preterm delivery. Although studies have shown an association between preterm delivery and bacterial vaginosis and Trichomonas vaginitis, studies have not shown that treatment reduces the risk. It remains uncertain whether or not chlamydial infection is associated with preterm delivery.",,

Acetaminophen is used in more combination products than any other drug, for a number of different indications. An FDA panel has recommended that stronger warnings about hepatotoxicity be added to the label information for acetaminophen.

Other predictors of the disease have been elusive. Serum aluminum is not predictive, although higher than normal brain aluminum levels have been studied for many years. Eating a low-fiber diet has no known correlation, and serum levels of Beta-carotene and vitamin E are not useful for predicting the development of Alzheimer's disease, although supplementation is considered helpful by some sources.",,

She returns 1 week later and is still symptomatic, and a saline wet prep again shows Trichomonas. Which one of the following is the most appropriate treatment at this time? ",Metronidazole gel 0.75% (MetroGel) intravaginally for 5 days,"Metronidazole, 2 g orally, plus metronidazole gel 0.75% intravaginally for 5 days","Metronidazole, 500 mg orally twice a day for 7 days",Clindamycin cream (Cleocin) 2% intravaginally for 7 days,"Sulfadiazine (Microsulfon), 4 g orally in a single dose, plus pyrimethamine (Daraprim), 200 mg orally in a single dose",,3,"The preferred treatment for Trichomonas vaginitis is metronidazole, 2 g given in a single oral dose. Certain strains of Trichomonas vaginalis, however, have diminished sensitivity to metronidazole. Patients who fail initial treatment with metronidazole should be retreated with 500 mg orally twice a day for 7 days. If treatment fails again, the patient should be treated with 2 g daily for 3-5 days. Metronidazole gel and clindamycin cream are useful for treating bacterial vaginosis, but are not effective in the treatment of Trichomonas vaginitis. Sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine are used to treat toxoplasmosis.",,
1851,1,Medicine,"A 30 year old black female sees you because her hair has been falling out over the past 2 months. She tells you that she straightened, waved, and lightened her hair about 3 months ago. Examination shows most of the hair loss to be in the midline of the scalp, with an area of dark hairs about 3 cm in length in the center region. There is no evidence of balding or scarring. A potassium hydroxide (KOH) scraping is negative. Which one of the following is most appropriate management? ",Psoralen plus ultraviolent light (PUVA),Advising the patient to avoid hair treatment products,Oral itraconazole (Sporanox),Topical minoxidil (Rogaine),Intralesional corticosteroids,,2,"The fact that this patient's hair is breaking off rather than coming out by the roots strongly suggests that her hair loss is the result of improper use of hair cosmetics. Findings that lend additional support to this diagnosis include the lack of scarring, the absence of bald areas, and the normal KOH examination for fungal elements. Bleaching and permanent straightening products contain hydrogen peroxide, which can reconfigure and weaken hair fiber bonds. Eventually, light to moderate brushing will cause the hair to break off and fall out. Treatment is preventive.",,

Cromolyn may be used safely in any pediatric age group, including infants. Ipatropium bromide is useful in the treatment of COPD but has very limited use for asthma. Inhaled Beta-adrenergic agents should be used every 4 hours if needed. Overuse of these agents has been associated with an increased mortality rate. ",,

They recommend ultrasonography in all these children following the first episode of febrile UTI, as well as either voiding cystourethrography or radionuclide cystography to rule out vesicourethral reflux (VUR). More than 50% of these children will have some VUR on these studies, and the degree of VUR correlates with renal parenchymal damage. All children should have urine for culture collected by suprapubic aspiration or urethral catheterization. The perineal bag has unacceptable rates of contamination, especially in girls and uncircumcised boys. A 7- to 14-day course of parenteral or oral antibiotics is recommended, with prophylactic oral antibiotics recommended until imaging studies are completed.",,

Drug levels are not usually monitoring for clozapine. Although seizures occur in 4% of cases, EEG monitoring is impractical and is not recommended. Extrapyramidal side effects and tardive dyskinesia do not occur with this drug.Agranulocytosis, although rare, can be fatal. Therefore, it is recommended that patients on clozapine be monitored with weekly CBC counts.",,
1857,6,Surgery,Five days after abdominal surgery a 56 year old male develops a fever of 38.6&deg;C (101.5&deg;F). Which one of the following postoperative diagnoses is the least likely cause of his fever? ,Pulmonary atelectasis,Wound infection,Pneumonia,Urinary tract infection,Thrombophlebitis,,1,"The classic teaching that pulmonary atelectasis is a cause of fever after abdominal surgery has been refuted. A study to determine the connection between postoperative fever and atelectasis found no relationship. The incidence of atelectasis increased daily after surgery, whereas the incidence of fever decreased. Wound infection is statistically the most common cause of postoperative fever. Thrombophlebitis is one of the most common causes of fever after the third postoperative day.FYI:The five W's of postoperative fever - Wind, Water, Walking, Wound and Wonder drugs POD 1-2: Wind: Atelectasis (without air) often cause fever. Reasons include being on a ventilator, inadequate sighs during surgery and (in the general surgery patient) incisional pain on deep breathing. This is treated with incentive spirometry because there is evidence that deep inspiration prevents atelectasis better than just coughing. POD 3-5: Water: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common. Foley catheters are sometimes still in place. POD 4-6: Walking: Deep venous thrombosis can occur. This is more of a problem in patients undergoing pelvic orthopedic or general surgery than in head and neck surgery. Subcutaneous low dose heparin and venous compression devices reduce the incidence of thromboembolization . Walking the patient on POD1 is the best way to prevent this complication.POD 5-7: Wound : Most wound infections occur during this period. Preoperative antibiotics are important to prevent or reduce the risk of infection in head and neck surgery that crosses mucosal linings. POD 7+: Wonder drugs : Drugs can cause fevers.(Note that in obstetrics and gynaecology, this W is &quot;womb&quot; and it precedes &quot;Wonder drugs&quot;). ",,

It was initially approved by the FDA just to treat osteoporosis because it increases bone density. It does not stimulate either endometrium or breast tissue. It does lower both LDL and total cholesterol. However, it can actually cause hot flashes, and is therefore not useful for managing menopausal symptoms.",,

1861,2,OBGYN,Which one of the following is associated with galactorrhea?,Hypothyroidism,Breast cancer,Fibrocystic breast disease,Adrenal insufficiency,Graves' disease,,1,"Galactorrhea, or inappropriate lactation, is a relatively common problem with multiple causes. Systemic disease is one cause, the most common being hypothyroidism. Low levels of thyroid hormone result in increased levels of thyrotopin-releasing hormone, which increases prolactin secretion. Galactorrhea and symptoms of hypothyroidism abate with thyroid hormone replacement therapy. This condition is not associated with breast cancer or fibrocystic disease of the breast. Cushing's disease, rather than adrenal insufficiency, is associated with galactorrhea.",,
1862,1,Medicine,"In evaluating an adult with anemia, which one of the following findings most reliably indicates a diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia? ",Low total iron-binding capacity,Low serum iron,Low serum ferritin,Microcytosis,Hypochromia,,3,"The total iron-binding capacity is elevated, not decreased, in iron deficiency anemia. As an acute-phase reactant, serum iron may be decreased in response to inflammation even when total body stores of iron are not decreased. Microcytosis and hypochromia are both features of iron deficiency anemia occurring late in its development, but both can also be seen in the thalassemias. Serum ferritin is also an acute-phase reactant but is normal or elevated in the face of an inflammatory process. A low serum ferritin, however, is diagnostic for iron deficiency even in its early stages.",,

However, the risk is small and only those already at increased risk of venous thromboembolism need to be concerned about it. The known complications of venous stasis must be avoided by the prophylactic use of ambulation and exercises during long flights. Patients at increased risk or presently on antithrombotic medications must be carefully monitored prior to their trip.",,

The most likely diagnosis is ",Dysgerminoma,Corpus luteum cyst,Serous cystadenoma,Dermoid cyst,Ovarian fibroma,,2,"Ovarian granulose cells become luteinized after ovulation to form a corpus luteum. At times blood may enter this body of cells and form a corpus hemorrhagicum, with later resolution by cyst formation. Focal pain and tenderness are prominent features. Following menarche, adnexal masses are most likely to be follicular and corpus luteum cysts of the ovary.While dysgerminomas are the most frequent ovarian malignancy in young women, they are not as frequent as corpus luteum and follicular cysts. Fibromas and thecomas account for up to 4% of ovarian tumors. They are most commonly seen in patients aged 40-60.",,

The most predictive risk factor for the presence of the disease is sexual activity at a young age. Other risks include being unmarried, black race, a past history of sexually transmitted disease, new or multiple sexual partners, cervical ectopy, and inconsistent use of barrier contraceptives. Asymptomatic Chlamydia infection can cause pelvic inflammatory disease and result in ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and chronic pelvic pain in women. There are good screening tests available and effective treatments for women with the disease. Unfortunately, there are currently no studies describing the effectiveness of routine screening or early treatment of men. The Preventive Services Task Force strongly recommends (class A) routine screening for Chlamydia infection in all sexually active women 25 years and younger, as well as in other asymptomatic women at increased risk. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend routine screening of sexually active adolescent women and screening of older women who are at increased risk for the disease.",,
1873,2,OBGYN,"A 28 year old gravida 2 para 1 successfully delivers a full-term infant vaginally. Her first child was delivered by cesarean section. With this delivery there are no signs of maternal pain, significant bleeding, or hemodynamic compromise during the first two stages of labor. However, 30 minutes after delivery of the infant there is still no umbilical cord elongation or contraction of the uterus, and the placenta is not at the cervical os. Manual exploration of the uterus reveals that the placenta is attached in a low anterior position and there is no easily discernible plane of separation. During this procedure, uterine bleeding becomes brisk and continues despite bimanual massage and administration of oxytocin (Pitocin), 10 U intramuscularly.Vital SignsTemperature 37.0&deg;C (98.6&deg;F)Pulse 120 beats/minBlood pressure 88/46 mm HgRespirations 20/minO2 Saturation 98% on room airWhich one of the following should be done next?

In this situation, the placenta has either partially or completely attached to the myometrium instead of the endometrium, which normally sloughs after birth, thus resulting in detachment of the placenta. The three forms of abnormal attachment (accreta, increta, and percreta) are difficult to differentiate by examination and are treated as the same condition, sometimes generally referred to as &ldquo;placenta accreta&rdquo;. No conservative mode of management will definitively treat these conditions when a significant portion of the placenta is abnormally attached. Therefore, if bleeding becomes profuse and the patient's condition is unstable, prompt hysterectomy is required.This patient has low blood pressure and an elevated pulse, likely due to significant blood loss. It is inappropriate to await spontaneous delivery of the placenta, which may never occur. Trying further to remove the placenta will only result in increased bleeding. Pulling on the umbilical cord may result in uterine inversion. There is no indication for any other manual maneuver.",,

According to the new guidelines, cervical cytologic screening should begin approximately 3 years after the onset of vaginal intercourse, and no later than 21 years of age. After initiation of screening, cervical screening should be done annually with conventional Papanicolaou (Pap) smears, or every 2 years using liquid-based cytology. At or after age 30, women are at conventional risk who have had 3 consecutive negative results and no abnormal results within the past 10 years. Screening with vaginal cytology following total hysterectomy for benign gynecologic disease is not indicated.

The elderly frequently take many mediations; reducing these medications also reduces the risk of falling. SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and anticonvulsants have the strongest association with falls in the elderly.The highest risk for falling occurs immediately after hospital stays and lasts for about a month. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is associated with so many false-negative and false-positive results that it cannot be recommended for all patients who fall.

",Factor VIII levels,Hemoglobin electrophoresis,Antithrombin level,Protein S and protein C levels,Testing for factor V Leiden,,1,"Hemophilia is X-linked and occurs in approximately 1 in 5000 male births, with 85% having factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A) and the remaining 15% having factor IX (hemophilia B) and factor XI (hemophilia C) deficiency. Because factor VIII does not cross the placenta, bleeding symptoms may be present from birth, with the most dreaded manifestation being intracranial hemorrhage. About 30% of affected male infants will bleed from the circumcision site. The only routine laboratory test that is affected by a reduced level of factor VIII is the activated partial thromboplastin time. Once hemophilia is suspected, the specific assay for factor VIII will confirm the diagnosis. Factor VIII levels in affected persons vary from less than 1% to approximately 25% of normal activity. Clinical severity of the disease varies with the degree of deficiency of factor VIII activity. Recently-developed recombinant factor VIII for treating patients with hemophilia can help prevent transfusion-related infections. Deficiencies of antithrombin III, protein S and protein C, and mutations of the gene for factor V (factor V Leiden) are associated with thrombotic conditions, not bleeding.",,

In one survey of 14 articles, the computed time to 50% failure of remission was 5 months, with the time of recurrence of mania being 5.2 times earlier than for depression. Mania tended to recur within 2.7 months, whereas depression was delayed for as long as 14 months. More than 50% of new episodes of illness occurred within 10 weeks of stopping therapy. In patients with mean cycle lengths before treatment of almost 12 months, their time to a new episode when off lithium therapy was less than 2 months.

On examination the child is lethargic with a tender abdomen, but no bowel distention. Of the following, which one is the most likely diagnosis? ",Duodenal atresia,Malrotation and midgut volvulus,Pyloric stenosis,Necrotizing enterocolitis,Jejunoileal atresia,,2,"Infants with malrotation and midgut volvulus often present in the first week of life with symptoms of bilious vomiting and bowel obstruction. Both duodenal and jejunoileal atresia most commonly present within the first 24 hours of life. Vomiting associated with pyloric stenosis is always non-bilious, and the diagnosis is most commonly made after the first week of life. Necrotizing enterocolitis may also be associated with bilious vomiting, but typically occurs at 10-12 days of life and is accompanied by abdominal distension and visible and/or palpable loops of bowel.",,

1908,3,PMCH,"As a member of the local emergency response management team you are asked about the treatment of nerve gas (e.g., sarin) poisoning. Which one of the following is most effective in reversing the symptoms of nerve gas toxicity? ","Albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin) via inhalation",Ciprofloxacin (Cipro),Atropine,"Parenteral verapamil (Calan, Isoptin)",Parenteral corticosteroids,,3,"Nerve gas agents such as sarin resemble organophosphate insecticides and inactive anticholinesterase, leading to the accumulation of acetylcholine at nerve endings. Respiratory symptoms include rhinorrhea, bronchorrhea, brochospasm, and respiratory muscule paralysis. gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Central nervous system symptoms include headache, vertigo, agitation, seizures, and coma. Exposed patients benefit from treatment with atropine, which competitively inhibits acetylcholine. Pralidoxine chloride and diazepam are also beneficial. Although Beta-agonists and corticosteroids are beneficial in the general tratment of bronchospasm, atropine is preferred in this situation. Verapamil and ciprofloxacin have no role in the treatment of nerve gas exposure.",,

While in the emergency department he becomes comatose with infrequent, gasping breaths and is quickly intubated and placed on a ventilator. A full evaluation shows an acute ischemic right-sided stroke. His wife states that she wishes to have the ventilator stopped, as she believes this would be consistent with her husband's wishes in this circumstance. She understands that this would precipitate the patient's death. The wife presents a legally valid advance directive confirming her as the patient's health-care proxy. Which one of the following responses to the wife's request is most ethically appropriate? ",Withdraw the ventilator as requested,Contact the hospital ethics committee to initiate the legal requirements to process the wife's request,Inform the wife that all life-sustaining care should be given until the patient's condition has been determined to be irreversible,"Inform the wife that intubation may have been avoided in the emergency department, but once life-sustaining care has been initiated it should not be withdrawn",Promptly contact hospital security or the local law enforcement agency to report the wife's request,,1,"Competent adult patients have the right to refuse any medical intervention, even if forgoing this treatment may result in their death. Legally or ethically it does not matter whether the patient requests that care be withheld before it is started, or that it be withdrawn once it is begun. All states currently allow competent patients to legally designate a health-care proxy to make these decisions for them if they become unable to communicate or incompetent to decide for themselves. The patient in this example has instituted such a legal advance directive and his proxy's desires should be respected as his own and the care withdrawn. If there were no advance directive the decision in this case would become more difficult, and might require a family conference or the involvement of an ethics committee. A patient's condition does not need to be terminal or irreversible in order to allow the removal of life-sustaining therapy. Legal involvement is rarely required in situations where advance directives are already available and valid.",,

She delivers a 4020-g (8 lb 14 oz) baby. Soon after delivery of the placenta, she begins to have excessive vaginal bleeding. Which one of the following would you do initially? ",Perform manual uterine exploration and massage,Perform uterine curettage,Administer intramuscular methylergonovine (Methergine),"Administer subcutaneous terbutaline (Brethine, Bricanyl)",Administer intramuscular prostaglandin F2alpha (carboprost) (Hemabate),,1,"The incidence of postpartum hemorrhage is 5%-8%. Causes include uterine atony, lacerations, retained placental products, and defects of coagulation. Uterine atony is the most likely cause of hemorrhage in this patient with multiple risk factors, including grand multiparity, a large fetus (uterine distension), and oxytocin induction. The initial step in management of postpartum hemorrhage should be manual uterine exploration followed by bimanual massage and compression of the uterus. This maneuver may need to be performed for upwards of 30 minutes. Intravenous oxytocin should also be infused simultaneously. Uterine curettage may be performed to attempt to remove retained placental products. however, it carries a significant risk of uterine perforation and should be delayed unless bleeding cannot be controlled by other means. Methergine is useful for postpartum hemorrhage but is contraindicated in this patient with hypertension. Terbutaline is a tocolytic and is not used for treatment of hemorrhage. Prostaglandin F2alpha is an effective treatment for postpartum hemorrhage, but should be reserved for use when uterine massage fails.",,
1915,2,OBGYN,"A 17 year old white female visits you for a physical examination prior to entering college. During the review of systems her only complaint is cyclic lower abdominal cramps around the onset of menstruation. She reports that pain has been present to some degree with most of her periods since about 6 months after menarche. The pain is often severe enough for her to miss school. Each episode lasts 24-48 hours and is somewhat relieved by rest and acetaminophen. Her menstrual history is otherwise normal. She denies ever being sexually active and tells you that she has received little empathy from her mother, who has similar symptoms as an adolescent that improved after her first pregnancy. Pelvic and rectal examinations are within normal limits. Which one of the following management choices would be appropriate at this time? ",Referral for hysterosalpingography,Referral for psychological counseling,Danazol (Danocrine),Acetaminophen/hydrocodone (Vicodin HP),Naproxen sodium (Anaprox),,5,"The patient's history is typical of primary dysmenorrheal, defined as severe cramping pain in the lower abdomen that occurs during menses; it may also occur prior to the onset of menses in the absence of associated pelvic pathology. Although many women complain of pain beginning with the first cycle, symptoms usually begin at the onset of ovulation around 6-12 months after menarche. Symptoms typically last 48 hours of less, but sometimes may last up to 72 hours. It is common to find daughters with dysmenorrheal whose mothers' had the same symptoms.In this patient, who has no history suggesting an emotional disorder, there is no need for psychological counseling at this time. Further evaluation could include ultrasonography to rule out causes of dysmenorrheal such as uterine leiomyomata, adnexal masses, and endometrial polyps. However, a trial of symptomatic therapy is most reasonable before other invasive studies, such as a laparoscopic examination or a hysterosaalpingogram, are ordered. It is not reasonable to begin danazol without a diagnosis of endometriosis, which is by definition seconday dysmenorrheal. Since neither inhibits prostaglandin synthetase, acetaminophen (which she had already tried without complete relief) combined with a narcotic is not an appropriate management strategy. Multiple placebo-controlled studies have shown that NSAIDS such as naproxen, at the onset of symptoms, provide significant relief of primary dysmenorrheal compared to placebo.",,
1916,2,OBGYN,"A full-term newborn, born 72 hours ago, is noted to be jaundiced. The pregnancy was uneventful and the delivery uncomplicated. The mother has type A-positive blood and the child has type O-positive. The child is breastfed and has lost 9 ounces from a birth weight of 8 lb. He is feeding for 20 minutes every 4 hours, and except for being icteric, has a normal examination.Laboratory evaluation reveals a total serum bilirubin level of 16 mg/dL (N 1.4-8.7), with a conjugated bilirubin level of 1.0 mg/dL. His hemoglobin level is 17.8 g/dL (N 13.4-19.8), his hematocrit is 55% (N 41-65), and his reticulocyte count is 3% (N 3-7). Appropriate management would include ",Phototherapy,Exchange transfer,Blood cultures and antibiotic therapy,Dextrose and water supplementation,A recommendation to increase feedings to 10 times a day,,5,"Hyperbilirubinemia can occur in up to 60% of term newborns during the first week of life. Early guidelines on management of elevated bilirubin were based on studies of bilirubin toxicity in infants who had hemolytic disease. Current recommendations now support the use of less intensive therapy in term newborns with jaundice who are otherwise healthy. Phototherapy should be initiated when the bilirubin level is above 15 mg/dL for infants at age 29-48 hours old, at 18 mg/dL for infants 49-72, and at 20 mg/dL in infants older than 72 hours. Generally, this problem is not considered pathologic unless it presents during the first hours after birth and the total serum bilirubin rises by more than 5 mg/dL/day or is higher than 17 mg/dL, or if the infant has signs or symptoms suggestive of a serious underlying illness such as sepsis. Fortunately, very few term newborns with jaundice have serious underlying pathology. Physiologic jaundice follows a pattern, with the bilirubin level peaking on the third or fourth day of life and then declining over the first week after birth. Infants with multiple risk factors may develop an exaggerated form of physiologic jaundice, with the total bilirubin level rising as high as 17 mg/dL. Breastfed infants are at an increased risk for exaggerated physiologic jaundice because of relative caloric deprivation in the first few days of life. Compared with formula-fed infants, those who are breastfed are six times more likely to experience moderate jaundice, with the bilirubin rising above 12 mg/dL.For breastfed newborns who have an early onset of hyperbilirubinemia, the frequency of feeding should be increased to more than 10 times per day. If the newborn has a decrease in weight gain, delayed stooling, and continued poor intake, then formula supplementation may be necessary. Breastfeeding should be continued to maintain breast milk production. Supplemental water or dextrose and water should not be given, as this can decrease breast milk production and may place the infant at risk for iatrogenic hyponatremia.",,

1920,2,OBGYN,"A 72 year old white female who is otherwise healthy complains of occasional incontinence. She reports that this occur mainly at night when she awakens with an intense desire to void, and by the time she is able to get to the bathroom she has &ldquo;wet herself&rdquo;. The most likely diagnosis is ",Sphincter incompetence,Detrusor instability,Detrusor hypotonia,Uninhibited neurogenic bladder,,,2,"Urinary incontinence is very common in the elderly female. Treatment depends entirely on a careful history to ascertain the exact circumstances when the patient wets herself. One of the most common types of incontinence results from uninhibited contractions of the detrustor muscle. This detrustor instability causes an intense urge to void, which overcomes the patient's voluntary attempt to hold the sphincter closed; hence, the common term urge incontinence.Other common causes of incontinence include a weak sphincter (sphincter incompetence), which leads to leakage associated with ordinary activites such as coughing or lifting (stress incontinence). Another common cause is overflow of urine from an abnormally distended, hypotonic, poorly contractile bladder (detrusor hypotonia). This is probably more common in males with longstanding obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy. A rare type of incontinence is caused by spinal cord damage. This reflex incontinence is due to the patient being unable to sense the need to void.",,

1922,1,Medicine,Which one of the following is the most common risk factor for retinal detachment? ,Posterior detachment of the vitreous,Hyphema,Glaucoma,Cataract surgery,Diabetic retinopathy,,1,"Vitreous detachment is very common after age 60 and occurs frequently in younger persons with myopia. The separation of the posterior aspect of the vitreous from the retina exerts traction on the retina, with the attendant risks of a retinal tear and detachment. Symptoms of retinal detachment may include light flashes (photopsia), a sudden appearance or increase in floaters, or peripheral visual field loss, any of which should prompt an ophthalmology referral. Cataract surgery can result in premature shrinkage of the vitreous and thereby poses an increased risk, but vitreous detachment resulting from other processes is more common. Hyphema, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy are not specific risk factors for retinal detachment.",,

She appears to be in mild emotional distress about being the &ldquo;last girl in her class to have a period&rdquo;. She is in no physical discomfort and her vital signs are normal. Secondary sexual characteristics appear to be developing normally. She is in the 57th percentile for height and the 65th percentile for weight. A complete physical examination confirms your presumptive diagnosis. The therapeutic procedure of choice would be ",Appendectomy,Colonoscopy,Hymenotomy,Cystoscopy,Paracentesis,,3,"The key to making a diagnosis of imperforate hymen, aside from the obvious finding on physical examination, lies in the systematic drawing of inferences. One can speculate that this patient's recurrent crescendo abdominal cramping represents six menstrual sheddings, with no egress from the body. Her delay in menarche, despite normal growth parameters, offers another clue that the structural amenorrhea is present. Amounts of retained blood vary among patients; up to 3000 mL have been reported. A large volume can accumulate without causing any permanent damage, and subsequent fertility is usually normal. Hymenotomy will relieve the pressure, and normal menses should ensure.",,
1924,4,Pediatrics,The treatment of choice for a 4 month old infant with suspected pertussis is: ,"Supportive care (respiratory, fluids) only",Ceftriaxone (Rocephin),Ampicillin,Gentamicin (Garamycin),Erythromycin,,5,"In spite of widespread vaccination of infants, pertussis occurs endemically in 3- to 5-year cycles in Canada. It appears to be more common within populations not routinely immunized, such as Mennonite communities, but can occur widely. Infants younger than 6 months are affected most severely, although pertussis occurs in all age groups. The diagnosis is made by nasopharyngeal culture, but because the disease is uncommon and the organism is fastidious, laboratory personnel should be advised of the physician's suspicion of pertussis. Treatment includes respiratory and nutritional supportive care, particularly for infants younger than 6 months. Antibiotic therapy is most effective in shortening the illness when given early, during the upper choice is erythromycin, 40-50 mg/kg/day divided into four doses, for 14 days. Also effective are azithromycin and clarithromycin, which may be better tolerated with improved compliance. Resistance to these agents is rare. Penicillins and cephalosporins are ineffective. Gentamicin is potentially very toxic and is not indicated.",,

Ten percent of falls result in a serious injury. Arthritis; depression; orthostasis; impaired cognition, vision, or gait; and the use of four or more prescription medications increase the risk of falling. Muscle strengthening and balance exercises and removal of physical hazards can reduce the rate of falling. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with falling, and empiric supplementation with vitamin D reduces the risk. Tricyclic antidepressants, neuroleptics, bezodiazepines, and type IA antiarrhythmics are linked to an increased risk of falling.",,

Her workup has been negative except for a positive lupus anticoagulant on two occasions, separated by 6 weeks. You make the diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. She has no previous history of venous or arterial thrombosis. The best medical management at this time is ",Acetaminophen,Warfarin (Coumadin),Prednisone,Aspirin and heparin combined,Progesterone,,4,"Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, fetal loss, thrombocytopenia, and poor pregnancy outcome. Studies comparing aspirin alone versus aspirin and heparin suggest that the combination of aspirin and heparin is most effective for decreasing fetal loss. One study showed decreased fetal loss with a combination of corticosteroids and aspirin, but the results have not been reproduced in subsequent studies. In addition, the use of prednisone was associated with an increased risk of premature rupture of membranes, preterm delivery, fetal growth restriction, infection, preeclampsia, diabetes, osteopenia, and avascular necrosis. Progesterone may be useful for recurrent spontaneous abortion related to a luteal phase defect, but has not been shown to be effective in preventing complications associated with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.",,

Amblyopia , or lazy eye, is the most common cause of visual loss, with a prevalence of 2% in childhood. It is often related to strabismus, in which the image from one eye is suppressed in order to eliminate diplopia. Iritis is unusual and may have minimal symptoms; it is frequently associated with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Glaucoma does occur in children, often after cataract surgery. Eye trauma is relatively common, especially in boys. They may sustain abrasions, foreign bodies and penetrating injuries. Conjunctivitis will usually resolve without visual loss except when complicated by keratitis, such as in herpetic infections.",,

",Prostate-specific antigen (PSA),Cancer antigen 27.29 (CA 27-29),Cancer antigen 125 (CA-125),Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA),Alpha-Fetoprotein,,4,"Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a marker for colon, esophageal, and hepatic cancers. It is expressed in normal mucosal cells and is overexpressed in adenocarcinoma, especially colon cancer. Though not specific for colon cancer, levels above 10 ng/mL are rarely due to benign disease. CEA levels typically return to normal within 4-6 weeks after successful surgical resection. Prostrate-specific antigen (PSA) is a marker that is used to screen for prostate cancer. It is elevated in more than 70% of organ-confined prostrate cancers. Cancer antigen 27-29 (CA 27-29) is a tumor marker for breast cancer. It is elevated in about 33% of early-stage cancers and about 67% of late-stage breast cancers. CA-125 is a marker for ovarian cancer. Although it is elevated in 85% of ovarian cancers, it is elevated in only 50% of early-stage ovarian cancers.

The underlying pathophysiology of PCOS includes insulin resistance leading to increased ovarian androgen production. LH and FSH levels are often elevated in PCOS, with the LH:FSH ratio often being greater than 3:1. Prolactin is usually normal, although mild elevations are possible. Marked elevations should prompt investigation of other causes. Elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels are seen in congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and high TSH values would point to hypothyroidism as a cause for this patient's oligomenorrhea.",,

1934,1,Medicine,A 45 year old white male presents with severe intermittent right flank pain that radiates into his right groin area. You suspect a ureteral stone. Which one of the following would most reliably confirm your suspected diagnosis? ,A helical CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast,Intravenous pyelography,Abdominal ultrasonography,A KUB plain film of the abdomen,A urinalysis,,1,"An unenhanced helical CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is the best study for confirming the diagnosis of a urinary tract stone in a patient with acute flank pain, supplanting the former gold standard, intravenous pyelography. A CT scan may also reveal other pathology, such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, or abdominal aortic aneurysm. Although abdominal ultrasonography has a very high specificity, it is still not better than CT, and its sensitivity is much lower; thus, its use is usually confined to pregnant patients with a suspected stone. Plain abdominal radiographs may show the stone if it is radiopaque, and are useful for following patients with radiopaque stones. CT will reveal a radiopaque stone. While most patients with stones will have hematuria, its absence does not rule out a stone.",,

",Oral bronchodilators,Inhaled corticosteroids,Inhaled Beta-agonists,Inhaled cholinergics,Home oxygen,,5,"Treatment of hypoxemia is critical in the management of COPD and trials have shown a reduction in mortality with the use of oxygen for 15 or more hours daily. Inhaled Beta-adrenergic agonists and cholinergic agents, either alone or in combination, provide symptomatic relief but do not prolong survival. Theophylline can be used for symptoms inadequately relieved by bronchodilators. Inhaled corticosteroids do not appear to alter the rate of decline in lung function in COPD. However, some evidence shows that these agents alleviate symptoms and reduce disease exacerbation. Pulmonary rehabilitation improves quality of life and reduces hospitalizations.",,

He has never had his PSA checked before.His medical history is significant for class IV heart failure treated with furosemide (Lasix), enalapril (Vasotec), carvedilol (Coreg), digoxin, and spironolactone (Aldactone). His review of systems is positive for longstanding nocturia and gradually worsening weakness of the urinary stream. His physical examination is noteworthy for bibasilar rales, an S 3 gallop, and moderate lower extremity edema. His prostate is diffusely large and smooth. His urinalysis is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate management for his elevated PSA? ",No intervention,Repeat testing after a course of antibiotics,Referral for a CT scan or MRI of the pelvis,Referral for prostate ultrasonography and biopsy,,,1,"The patient described has a life expectancy that makes the risk-benefit ratio for the detection of asymptomatic prostate cancer extremely unfavorable. In addition, a mildly elevated PSA in a 78-year-old with a large prostrate is most likely due to benign prostatic hypertrophy.",,

The modest effects observed over 3 years, if accumulated over 10-20 years, may explain the one-third reduction in risk for hip fracture associated with thiazide use in many epidemiologic studies. There are no such benefits reported for the other medications listed.",,
1942,5,Psychiatry,"A 34 year old white female comes to the office for a Papanicolaou (Pap) test. On a review-of-system checklist, she checks yes to depressive symptoms, insomnia, and anxiety. On questioning, she admits to feeling depressed for about 4 months, after a recent job change. She is not suicidal. With probing, she admits that she repeatedly checks her locks and constantly worries about cleanliness; she has been this way all of her life, but finds it very time-consuming. Which one of the following drugs is the best choice for this patient? ",Risperidone (Risperdal),Clorazepate (Tranxene),Clonazepam (Klonopin),Imipramine (Tofranil),Fluoxetine (Prozac),,5,The patient most likely has obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with a depressive episode. SSRIs are most frequently used. Risperidone and clonazepam are considered second-line drugs and are used as augmentation drugs when there is a partial response to an SSRI. There is no evidence that clorazepate or imipramine is effective in OCD. ,,

He has a history of previous heart attack but is otherwise in fine health. Which one of the following findings would support a diagnostic impression of peripheral vascular disease? ,Pain during rest and exercise and the presence of swelling and soreness behind the knee and in the calf,Pain that begins immediately upon walking and is unrelieved by rest,Doppler waveform analysis showing accentuated waveforms at a point of decreased blood flow,Treadmill arterial flow studies showing a 20-mm Hg decrease in ankle systolic blood pressure immediately following exercise,An ankle-brachial index of 1.15,,4,"Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is a clinical manifestation of artherosclerotic disease and is caused by occlusion of the arteries to the legs. Patients with significant arterial occlusive disease will have a prominent decrease in the ankle-brachial index from baseline following exercise, and usually a 20-mm Hg or greater decrease in systolic blood pressure. Pain during rest and exercise and the presence of swelling and soreness behind the knee and in the calf is found in those with Baker's cysts. Peripheral nerve pain commonly begins immediately upon walking and is unrelieved by rest. Doppler waveform analysis is useful in the diagnosis of PVD and will reveal attenuated waveform at a point of decreased blood flow. Employment of the ankle-brachial index is encouraged in daily practice as a simple means to diagnose the presence of PVD. Generally, ankle-brachial indices in the range of 0.91-1.30 are thought to be normal.",,

Adjusted for gestational age, maternal weight, and race, the results are significantly elevated. Which one of the following would you now recommend? ",No further testing,Amniocentesis,A maternal serum hCG level,Fetal ultrasonography,Chorionic villus sampling,,4,"A 16-week visit is advised for all pregnant women to offer an alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) screening for neural tube defects and Down syndrome. An AFP level 2-5 times the median value for normal controls at the same gestational age is considered elevated. Approximately 5%-10% of patients who undergo AFP screening will have an elevated level, and most of these women will have normal fetuses. Fetal ultrasonography should be performed to detect multiple gestation, fetal demise, or fetal anomalies (neural tube defects, ventral abdominal wall defects, and urinary tract anomalies) as well as to confirm gestational age, as all of these factors are associated with elevated AFP levels. Amniocentesis is offered if the ultrasonography does not indicate the reason for the elevated AFP. Chorionic villus sampling is offered in the evaluation of suspected chromosomal anomalies as an adjunct to amniocentesis. Serum hCG would be indicated in the workup of suspected Down syndrome, where the AFP would be low, not elevated. The hCG level would be expected to be over 2-5 multiples of the mean (MoM) with Down syndrome.",,

In fact, she tells you that she has not seen a physician since her hysterectomy for fibroids 20 years ago. Her only medication is occasional acetaminophen or ibuprofen for knee pain. Physical examination reveals a blood pressure of 160/90 mm Hg, an irregularly irregular heartbeat with a rate of 90/min, and otherwise normal cardiovascular examination, and a completely normal neurologic examination. Her EKG confirms atrial fibrillation with evidence for left ventricular hypertrophy but no Q waves or ST elevation. You are able to obtain an emergent CT scan of the brain without contrast, which is negative. Which one of the following is the most appropriate immediate management? ",Lowering blood pressure,Antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel (Plavix),Anticoagulation with heparin. ,Electrical or chemical cardioversion,An MRI scan of the brain with contrast,,3,"The patient described presents with a history most consistent with a recent, resolved transient ischemic attack (TIA). This was most likely due to an embolus related to her atrial fibrillation. Her risk for a recurrent neurologic event (TIA or stroke) is high. Long-term anticoagulation with warfarin reduces this risk. The use of antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel to reduce TIAs has not been studied. Lowering blood pressure and lipid levels can reduce risks over the long term, but do not require immediate intervention.Cardioversion for patients with atrial fibrillation of uncertain or long duration may be appropriate but should not be attempted before several weeks of anticoagulation in the stable patient. Because cardioversion can lead to systemic emboli, heparin should be given before medical cardioversion is attempted. Anticoagulation with warfarin (Coumadin) should be continued for four weeks after cardioversion.",,

",Recommend symptomatic treatment,Perform a rapid antigen test for streptococcal pharyngitis,Treat empirically for streptococcal pharyngitis,Perform a throat culture for streptococcal pharyngitis,Perform an office test for mononucleosis,,1,"Pharyngitis is a common complaint, and usually has a viral cause. The key factors in diagnosing streptococcal pharyngitis are a fever over 100.4F, tonsillar exudates, anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and absence of cough. Age plays a role also, with those 15 years of age more likely to have streptococcal infection, and those 10-25 years of age more likely to have mononucleosis. The scenario described is consistent with a viral infection, with no risk factors to make streptococcal infection likely; therefore, this patient should be offered symptomatic treatment for likely viral infection. Testing for other infections is not indicated unless the patient worsens or does not improve.",,

1954,2,OBGYN,"A 20 year old single white female who is a patient of yours was raped in her apartment at 7:00 a.m. today. She is brought to your office at 9:00 a.m. for assessment and treatment. Despite having occasional intercourse with her boyfriend, she has never used any type of contraceptive. Their last intercourse was approximately 1 week ago, and the boyfriend has been out of town on business since then. The patient has a history of irregular periods, and her last normal period was approximately 2 1/2 weeks ago. You note live sperm on a wet mount. In addition to many other issues that must be addressed at this visit, the patient asks about emergency contraception. Which one of the following would be accurate advice to the patient regarding this topic? ","Emergency contraception does not interfere with an established, post-implantation pregnancy",The estrogen/progestin combination regimen appears to be more effective than the levonorgestrel-only regimen,"To be most effect, each dose of the 2-dose regimen should be administered at least 72 hours apart",Fetal malformations have been reported as a result of the unsuccessful use of the high-dose emergency contraceptive regimen,,,1,"An FDA Advisory Committee has recommended over-the-counter marketing of Plan B, an emergency contraceptive package that contains two 0.75-mg tablets of levonorgestrel to be taken 12 hours apart. Plan B is one of the two FDA-approved products for this indication. The Preven emergency contraceptive kit includes four tablets, each containing 0.25 mg of levonorgestrel and 50 g of ethinyl estradiol; these are taken two at a time 12 hours apart. In a randomized, controlled trial comparing the single versus combined estrogen/progestin, the single-drug regimen was shown to be more effective. Pregnancy occurred in 11 of 976 women (1.1%) given levonorgestrel alone, and in 31 of 979 (3.2%) given ethinyl estradiol plus levonorgestrel. The proportion of pregnancies prevented, compared to the expected number without treatment, was 85% with levonorgestrel and 57% with the combination. In both regimens, the interval between individual doses is 12 hours. In this case, emergency contraception may be appropriate in the face of a possible pregnancy from previous consensual intercourse. Emergency contraception has not been found to interfere with an established post-implantation pregnancy. Furthermore, no fetal malformations have been reported as a results of the unsuccessful use of high-dose oral contraceptives for emergency contraception.",,

She has read in a popular magazine that immunization for pertussis and measles may predispose to asthma and other atopic illnesses. ,Pertussis and measles immunizations should be withheld in children with a strong family history of asthma,"Because of association between pertussis vaccine and atopic disease, an antihistamine should be administered before giving pertussis vaccine",There is no conclusive evidence that pertussis or measles immunization carries any risk of increased atopic disease,Measles vaccine should not be administered to any child with a history of urticaria,,,3,"Although some older studies showed a possible increase in asthma and other atopic illness in children vaccinated for pertussis, more recent, better controlled trials have shown no association. Studies have failed to demonstrate an association between atopic disease and measles immunization. Therefore, there is no recommendation to withhold immunizations from children to prevent atopic disease. Allergy to the specific vaccine would, of course, be a valid reason not to vaccinate.",,

Lidocaine may subsequently be utilized if necessary. Verapamil has been shown to reverse cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm. Beta-Adrenergic blocking drugs have been shown to exacerbate coronary vasospasm by resulting in unopposed alpha-adrenergic activity. Beta-Blockers are therefore contraindicated in the treatment of cocaine-induced cardiac problems.",,

Which of the following would be most appropriate? ",Reassurance,Foot stretching exercises,Use of orthotics,Use of night splints,Surgery,,1,"Intoeing, as described, is usually caused by internal tibial torsion. This problem is believed to be caused by sleeping the prone position, and sitting on the feet. In 90% of cases, internal tibial torsion gradually resolves without intervention by the age of 8. Avoiding prone sleeping enhances resolution of the problem. Night splints, orthotics, and shoe wedges are ineffective.

However, only alprazolam has an onset of action measured in hours instead of weeks, making it the most appropriate choice for managing acutely distressed patients. Because of the difficulty in discontinuing benzodiazepines, their most common use is to stabilize severe initial symptoms until another treatment becomes effective.",,
1962,2,OBGYN,A 36 year old Asian gravida 1 para 1 presents with pain and bleeding due to a large uterine fibroid confirmed by examination and pelvic ultrasonography. The patient requests treatment but wants to preserve her fertility. Which one of the following is the best treatment? ,Oral contraceptives,Uterine artery embolization,Metformin (Glucophage),Myomectomy,,,4,"In the younger patient who wishes to retain fertility, myomectomy is the surgical treatment of choice in significantly symptomatic uterine fibroids. Uterine artery embolization, while effective, may induce menopause of reduce fertility by decreasing ovarian reserve. It has also been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including malpresentation, preterm birth, and postpartum hemorrhage. Although oral contraceptives are useful in dysmenorrhea and dysfunctional uterine bleeding, they are ineffective in symptoms secondary to uterine myomas. GnRH agonists, danazol, and mifepristone are effective medications for symptomatic uterine fibroids. Metformin is useful in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome, but not for fibroids.",,

Vision of 20/40 is the minimum allowed under Department of Transportation regulations. Adequate hearing in one ear and well-compensated controlled heart disease are both allowed. Blood pressure of 160/90 mm Hg or less merits an unrestricted 2-year certification. Drivers with a blood pressure of 160/90  181/105 mm Hg can receive a 3-month temporary certification during which treatment for hypertension should be undertaken.",,

Which one of the following would be the most appropriate antidepressant for this patient? ",Amitriptyline (Elavil),Doxepin (Sinequan),Trazodone (Desyrel),Sertraline (Zoloft),Olanzapine (Zyprexa),,4,"Amitriptyline, doxepin, MAO inhibitors, and clomipramine should be avoided in nursing-home patients. SSRIs are the most appropriate first-line pharmacologic treatment for depression in nursing-home residents. Other classes of non-tricyclic antidepressant may be effective and appropriate, but the evidence for this is not as good as the evidence for SSRIs.",,
1966,2,OBGYN,The definition of a post-term pregnancy is a pregnancy that has reached,40 weeks gestation,41 weeks gestation,42 weeks gestation,39 weeks gestation,,,3,Postdate and post-term pregnancy are terms that are used interchangeably. The postdate pregnancy is defined as a pregnancy that has reached 42 weeks of amenorrhea. This is important because perinatal mortality doubles at 42 weeks gestational age. The diagnosis of postdate pregnancy depends heavily on accurate dating methods.,,

",Enalapril,Furosemide,Labetalol,Insulin,Heparin,,5,"A number of medications can cause thrombocytopenia, but heparin is a more likely cause than enalapril, furosemide, labetalol, or insulin. Even the small doses of heparin used to flush intravenous lines can be a source of thrombocytopenia.",,
1969,1,Medicine,A 57 year old white male with coronary artery disease suffered a cardiac arrest while jogging 10 days ago. He was resuscitated after 45 minutes but has remained unresponsive and on a ventilator since then. Which one of the following is required to diagnose brain death in this patient? ,Hypothermia,Continuous mechanical ventilation,The absence of spontaneous body movements,Electroencephalographic confirmation,Normal corneal reflexes,,4,An electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the most well-validated tests for confirming brain death. The presence of hypothermia will confound any attempt to determine brain death; the patient must be warm to ensure the diagnosis. The mechanical ventilator may give false readings and must be discontinued to get a real picture of the patient's ability to breathe. Spontaneous body movements can occur even hours after actual brain death. Corneal reflexes never occur after death.,,

The most likely cause of these lesions is: ",Pyrogenic granuloma,Leishmaniasis,Atypical mycobacterial infection,Squamous cell carcinoma,Epidermal inclusion cysts,,2,"The most likely diagnosis is cutaneous leishmaniasis, caused by an intracellular parasite transmitted by the bite of small sandflies. Lesions develop gradually, and are often misdiagnosed as folliculitis or as infected epidermal inclusion cysts, but they fail to respond to usual skin antibiotics. Hundreds of cases have been diagnosed in troops returning from Iraq, most likely due to Leishmania major.Treatment is not always required, as most lesions will resolve over several months; however, scarring is frequent.

Her condition has significantly worsened in the past 3 years, to the point that it is endangering her marriage of 5 year. Her symptoms are worse for the 10 days prior to her menstrual period and are gone by day 2 of her period. She has tried several measures without success, including birth control pills, various herbal preparations, and counseling at a woman's health center. You recommend  ",Reduction of caffeine and refined sugar intake,Alprazolam (Xanax),Bupropion (Wellbutrin),Progesterone,"Fluoxetine (Prozac, Serafem) ",,5,"SSRIs are considered first-line treatment for premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Several randomized trials have shown that they are superior to placebo for this condition. Fluoxetine and sertraline have been studied the most. There have been no controlled trials to support anecdotal reports of benefit from the reduction of caffeine or refined sugar. Studies using alprazolam have shown it to be effective for premenstrual anxiety only. Progesterone has not been proven more effective than placebo in clinical trials, and bupropion is less effective than agents that primarily boost serotonergic activity. Treatment during the luteal phase alone has been shown to be more effective than continuous treatment for this condition.",,

Nasal polyps tend to occur more often in adult males, with the prevalence increasing in both sexes after age 50. Any child 12 years or younger who presents with nasal polyps should be suspected of having cystic fibrosis until proven otherwise. A sweat chloride test, along with a history and clinical examination, is necessary to evaluate this possibility. Nasal polyps are found in 1% of the normal population, but a full 18% of those with cystic fibrosis are afflicted.

1975,1,Medicine,A 72 year old male with class III congestive heart failure (CHF) due to systolic dysfunction asks if he can take ibuprofen for his aches and pains. Appropriate counseling regarding NSAID use and heart failure should include which one of the following? ,NSAIDs are a good choice for pain relief as they decrease systemic vascular resistance,NSAIDs are a good choice for pain relief as they augment the effect of his diuretic,High-dose aspirin (325 mg/day) is preferable to other NSAIDs for patients taking ACE inhibitors,"NSAIDs, including high-dose aspirin, should be avoided in CHF patients because they can cause fluid retention",,,4,"If possible, NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with heart failure. They cause sodium and water retention as well as an increase in systemic vascular resistance which may lead to cardiac decompensation. Patients with heart failure who take NSAIDs have a tenfold increased risk of hospitalization for exacerbation of their CHF. NSAIDs alone in patients with normal ventricular function have not been associated with initial episodes of heart failure.NSAIDs, including high-dose aspirin (325 mg/day) may decrease of negate entirely the beneficial unloading effects of ACE inhibition. They have been shown to have a negative impact on the long-term morbidity and mortality benefits that ACE inhibitors provide. Sulindac and low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day) are less likely to cause these negative effects.",,

Her bleeding subsides in several hours, no new skin lesions develop, and her PT/INR decreases to 32 sec/3.0, 23 sec/2.1, and 15 sec/1.4 on subsequent days. You suspect that the child's condition is due to: ",Acetaminophen overdose,Antiphospholipid syndrome with lupus anticoagulant,Munchausen syndrome by proxy,Henoch-Schonlein purpura,Traumatic injury (child abuse),,3,"The patient exhibits signs of moderate bleeding diathesis. Her prothrombin time (PT) elevation, without evidence of hepatocellular damage or hepatic dysfunction, is highly suspicious for warfarin ingestion. The normalization of the PT under observation in a hospital setting is consitent with this suspicion. Although accidental poisoning is a possibility, the mother's affect is highly suspicious for Munchausen syndrome by proxy. The fact that her mother is a health-care worker and develops a close and appropriate relationship with the health-care team is consistent with this diagnosis. Acetaminophen toxicity of this degree would likely produce transaminase and bilirubin elevations, as well as mental status changes. Antiphospholopid syndrome produces a hypercoagulable state. Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura presents with purpura, joint pain, abdominal pain, and a normal PT. Traumatic injury would not result in PT elevations.",,

The most likely diagnosis is ",Lupus erythematosus,Pemphigoid gestationis (herpes gestationis),Melasma (chloasma),Prurigo gestationis,,,3,"Melasma or chloasma is common in pregnancy, with approximately 70% of pregnant women affected. It is an acquired hypermelanosis of the face, with symmetric distribution usually on the cheeks, nose, eyebrows, chin, and/or upper lip. The pathogenesis is not known. UV sunscreen is important, as sun exposure worsens the condition. Melasma often resolves or improves post partum. Persistent melasma can be treated with hydroquinone cream, retinoic acid, and/or chemical peels performed post partum by a dermatologist.The facial rash of lupus is usually more erythematous, and lupus is relatively rare. Pemphigoid gestationis is a rare autoimmune disease with extremely pruritic, bullous skin lesions that usually spare the face.

",Failure to treat this patient would place her at higher risk of later infertility,Only sexual partners with whom she has been active during the last 2 weeks need to be treated,She should avoid sexual intercourse for 1 month of treatment,Use of barrier methods of contraception increases her risk for repeat infection,,,1,"It is recommended that sexually active women under the age of 25 years be screened routinely for Chlamydia trachomatis. Treatment of asymptomatic infections in women reduces their risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease, tubal infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. A 1-gram dose of oral azithromycin is an appropriate treatment, including during pregnancy. Sexual contacts during the preceding 60 days should be either treated empirically or tested for infection and treated if positive. The patient should avoid sexual intercourse for 7 days after initiation of treatment. Consistent use of barrier methods for contraception reduces the risk of C. trachomatis genital infection.",,

The patient has completed radiation treatments to the breast. She is afebrile and there is no axillary adenopathy. There is no wound drainage, crepitance, or bullous lesions. Which of the following organisms would be the most likely cause of cellulites in this patient? ",Non-group A Streptococcus,Pneumococcus pneumoniae,Clostridium perfringens,Escherichia coli,Pasteurella multocida,,1,"Cellulitis in patients after breast lumpectomy is thought to be related to lymphedema. Axillary dissection and radiation predispose to these infections. Non-group A hemolytic Streptococcus is the most common organism associated with this infection. The onset is often several weeks to several months after surgery.Pneumococcus is more frequently a cause of periorbital cellulites. It is also seen in patients who have bacteremia with immunocompromised status. Immunocompromising conditions would include diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, lupus, nephritic syndrome, and some hematologic cancers.Clostridium and Escherichia coli are more frequently associated with crepitant cellulites. It is also seen in patients who have bacteremia with immunocompromised status.

She is not sexually active, has no vaginal discharge, and her menses occurred as expected about 3 weeks ago. She has not had any fever or rigors. A clean-catch, mid-stream urine specimen shows numerous white blood cells and rod-like bacteria per high-power field. She developed a generalized, pruritic rash when treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra) for a bout of otitis media as a child. In addition, your hospital laboratory has been reporting a high incidence (20%) of Escherichia coli resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. In this clinical setting, which one of the following regimens is the best treatment? ",Azithromycin (Zithromax) in a single dose,Metronidazole (Flagyl) in a single dose,Amoxicillin (Amoxil)  for 5 days,Sustained-release nitrofurantoin (Macrobid) for 5 days,Cefpodoxime (Vantin) for 10 days,,4,"Acute uncomplicated cystitis in women can be effectively and inexpensively treated with a 3-day course of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole before the infecting organism is known. Generally, either trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, a fluoroquinolone, or nitrofurantoin is a suitable choice for uncomplicated cystitis. Because of a probable drug allergy and a high prevalence of resistant Escherichia coli in the community, this patient should not be given trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. A fluroquinolone is not listed among the choices. Thus, in a patient with acute, uncomplicated cystitis, the most appropriate regimen from the choices listed is nitrofurantoin for 5-7 days.Urinary tract infections that recur after the use of antimicrobial agents, or that are acquired in the hospital or nursing home, are more likely to be due to antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacilli. A fluoroquinolone, oral amoxicillin/clavulanate, or an oral third-generation cephalosporin such as cefpodoxime, cefdinir, or ceftibuten can be useful in treating such infections in the outpatient setting. However, the patient described here does not fall into these categories. Neither azithromycin nor metronidazole alone is indicated as the drug of choice for a simple bacterial urinary tract infection. They are commonly used for the treatment of chlamydial cervicits and trichomoniasis of the urogenital tract, respectively.Until recent years, the standard treatment for a UTI was 10 days of amoxicillin, a penicillin antibiotic, but it is now ineffective against E. coli bacteria in up to 25% of cases.

This is an obstetric emergency that requires appropriate assistance and a calm but timely approach to ensure a safe delivery. While all of the maneuvers described are steps in managing shoulder dystocia, the McRoberts maneuver by itself (maximal flexion and abduction of the maternal hips) relieves the impaction of the anterior shoulder against the maternal symphysis in a large percentage of cases, especially when combined with suprapubic pressure.",,

Serum transferrin saturation is the best initial screening value. Serum ferritin concentration is a sensitive measure of iron overload, but ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and is therefore elevated in a variety of infectious and inflammatory conditions in the absence of iron overload.",,

Review of the growth chart shows that length, weight, and head circumference have continued to remain at the 75th percentile. The examination is normal with the exception of the anterior fontanelle being closed. Proper management at this time would include: ",A CT scan of the head,MRI of the head,"A CBC, a metabolic profile, and thyroid studies",Referral to a neurologist,Serial measurement of head circumference,,5,"The anterior fontanelle in the newborn is normally 0.6-3.6 cm, with the mean size being 2.1 cm. It may actually enlarge the first few months, but the medial age of closure is 13.8 months. The anterior fontanelle closes at 3 months in 1% of cases, and by 1 year, 38% are closed.While early closure of the anterior fontanelle may be normal, the head circumference must be carefully monitored. The patient needs to be monitored for craniosynostosis (premature closure of one of more sutures) and for abnormal brain development. When craniosynostosis is suspected, a skull radiograph is useful for initial evaluation. If craniosynostosis is seen on the film, a CT scan should be obtained.",,

Friends in the band have told her that she appears to be pale and sweaty when these episodes occur. No seizure activity has ever been observed. In each instance she regains consciousness almost immediately; there is no postictal state. She has been seen in the emergency department for this on two occasions with normal vital signs, physical findings, and neurologic findings. A CBC, a metabolic profile, and an EKG are also normal. Which one of the following tests is most likely to yield the correct diagnosis? ",A sleep-deprived EEG,24-hour Holter monitoring,A pulmonary/cardiac stress test,An echocardiogram,Tilt table testing,,5,"Reflex syncope is a strong diagnostic consideration for episodes of syncope associated with a characteristic precipitating factor. The major categories of syncope include carotid sinus hypersensitivity, and neurally mediated and situational syncopes. The most common and benign forms of syncope are neurally mediated or vasovagal types with sudden hypotension, frequently accompanied by bradycardia. Other terms for this include neurocardiogenic, vasomotor, neurovascular, or vasodepressive syncope. Most patients are young and otherwise healthy. The mechanism of the syncope seems to be a period of high sympathetic tone (often induced by pain or fear), followed by sudden sympathetic withdrawal, which then triggers a paradoxical vasodilation and hypotension. Attacks occur with upright posture, often accompanied by a feeling of warmth or cold sweating, lightheadedness, yawning, or dimming of vision. If the patient does not lie down quickly he or she will fall, with the horizontal position allowing a rapid restoration of central profusion. Recovery is rapid, with no focal neurologic sense of confusion or headache. The event can be duplicated with tilt testing, demonstrating hypotension and bradycardia.",,

On examination you find a jagged laceration about 2 cm long that extends into the fatty tissue. Which one of the following would be appropriate in the management of this injury? ,Copiously irrigate the wound with normal saline and secondary closure,Allow healing by secondary intention,Primary closure,Give metronidazole (Flagyl) prophylactically,Have the animal killed and the brain tissue analyzed,,1,"Dog bites are a common medical problem. Timely and copious irrigation with normal saline or Ringer's lactate will reduce the rate of infection markedly. Recent wounds and wounds on the faces are usually closed primarily unless contraindicated such as in animal/human bites, crush injuries, long time lapse (&gt;6-7h), retained foreign body, infection. When primary closure is not possible or indicated, the secondary closure (spontaneous healing) is employed. Cultures are usually not helpful unless the wound appears infected. Amoxicilllin/clavulanate is the antibiotic of choice for a dog bite. Since this is a neighbor's dog, it can be observed at home for 10 days if the rabies vaccination is current, or at a veterinarian's office if vaccination status is unknown.",,

After proper preparation, you perform sigmoidoscopy and note that the anal and rectal mucosa contain scattered areas of bluish-black discoloration. Which one of the following is the most likely explanation for the sigmoidoscopic findings? ",Endometriosis,Collagenous colitis,Melanosis coli,Metastatic malignant melanoma,Arteriovenous malformations,,3,"This patient has typical findings of melanosis coli, the term used to describe black or brown discoloration of the mucosa of the colon. It results from the presence of dark pigment in large mononuclear cells or macrophages in the lamina propria of the mucosa. The coloration is usually most intense just inside the anal sphincter and is lighter higher up in the sigmoid colon. The condition is thought to result from fecal stasis and the use of anthracene cathartics such as cascara sagrada, senna, and danthron. Ectopic endometrial tissue (endometriosis) most commonly involves the serosal layer of those parts of the bowel adjacent to the uterus and fallopian tubes, particularly the rectosigmoid colon. Collagenous colitis does not cause mucosal pigmentary changes. Melanoma rarely metastasizes multicentrically to the bowel wall.

2000,2,OBGYN,Which one of the following vaccines is contraindicated in pregnancy?,Tetanus and diphtheria (Td),Influenza,Rabies,Hepatitis B,MMR,,5,"Although the risk of transmitting a virus to a developing fetus is primarily theoretic, live-virus vaccines are generally contraindicated in pregnancy. MMR is a live attenuated vaccine and thus should be avoided in pregnancy. If it is inadvertently given, or a woman becomes pregnant within 4 weeks of administration, the woman should be counseled regarding potential adverse effects on the fetus, but should not be advised that it is an indication for termination.Tetanus and diphtheria vaccine (Td) should be routinely recommended for pregnant women who have not received Td in the past 10 years, or who have never been immunized. The influenza vaccine is a killed-virus preparation and is recommended for all women who will be pregnant during the influenza season.Rabies vaccination has not been associated with any fetal abnormalities. Due to the potential severe consequences of rabies exposure to the mother and fetus, the guidelines for postexposure prophylaxis in pregnancy are similar to those for the nonpregnant patient. Hepatitis B vaccine is composed of a viral surface antigen made through recombinant DNA technology and poses no risk to the mother or fetus. It should be routinely recommended to women who have risk factors including multiple sexual partners, a history of intravenous drug use or a partner with a history of intravenous drug use, occupational exposure, or household contact with a chronic carrier or acutely infected person.",,

Which one of the following treatment options is the most effective for long-term management of the majority of patients with this disorder? ,Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT),Tricyclic antidepressants,SSRIs,Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors,Lithium,,5,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is as effective as medication for the acute treatment of the severe depression and/or mania of bipolar disorder. However, ECT should be reserved for patients with severe mood syndromes who may be unable to wait for mood-stabilizing drugs to take effect. Neuroleptic (antipsychotic) drugs are effective in acute mania, but are not recommended for long-term use because of side effects. Bipolar depression generally responds to tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, and MAO inhibitors, but when used as long-term therapy these drugs may induce episodes of mania.Anticonvulsants, such as carbamazepine, valproic acid, and benzodiazepines, have been useful adjuncts combined with lithium in patients with breakthrough episodes of mania and/or depression. Lithium is the classic mood stabilizer. It has been shown to have antimanic efficacy, prophylactic efficacy in bipolar disorder, and some efficacy in prophylaxis against bipolar depression. Lithium remains the drug of choice for long-term treatment of the majority of patients with bipolar illness.",,

The dosage is 1 mg/kg subcutaneously twice daily. Patient chosen for outpatient care should have good cardiopulmonary reserve, normal renal function, and no risk for excessive bleeding. Oral anticoagulation with warfarin can be initiated on the first day of treatment after heparin loading is completed.Monotherapy with warfarin is inappropriate. The incidence of thrombocytopenia with low-molecular-weight heparin is lower than with conventional heparin. The INR should be maintained at 2.0-3.0 in this patient.

The patient is not on any new medications, and has no previous medical problems. Over the past 2 days, she has become concerned about memory loss for both recent and remote events. This patient most likely has ",Depression,Dementia,A brain tumor,Hypoglycemia,Myocardial infarction,,1,"The diagnosis of depression requires the presence of at least five of the following: depressed mood, sleep disturbance, lack of interest or pleasure in activities, guilt and feelings of worthlessness, lack of energy, loss of concentration and difficulty making decisions, anorexia or weight loss, psychomotor agitation or retardation, and suicidal ideation. The symptoms must be present nearly every day during a 2-week period. Because dementia may cause similar symptoms, distinguishing between the two is important. Dementia is insidious, with a long duration of symptoms including fluctuating mood and memory impairment for recent events. Memory loss often precedes mood changes. Organic problems such as brain tumor, hypoglycemia, and myocardial infarction may cause similar symptoms, but are far less likely to be the cause.",,
2006,3,PMCH,Which one of the following is an effective screening method for ovarian cancer in elderly females at average risk?,Annual CA-125 assays,Annual pelvic ultrasonography,Annual Papanicolaou (Pap) tests and pelvic examinations,No currently available method,,,4,"Two large European trials studied the use of CA-125 and CA-125 with transvaginal ultrasonography (TVU) as screening methods for ovarian cancer. TVU has been reviewed separately. None of these methods is effective as a screening test. No major organization recommends screening women at average risk. The Cancer Society does not recommend routine screening; the College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends against population-based screening; an NIH consensus conference recommended obtaining a family history and performing annual pelvic examinations. The Preventive Services Task Force graded routine screening for ovarian cancer as a D, meaning that there is fair evidence to recommend excluding ovarian cancer screening as a part of the periodic health examination. This recommendation reflects both a lack of benefit from screening and the fact that a significant number of women have to undergo exploratory surgery to find a single case.",,
2007,2,OBGYN,The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends antenatal screening for group B streptococcal disease by ,Culturing the urine at 20 weeks gestation,Obtaining cultures from the rectum and vaginal introitus at 20 weeks gestation,Obtaining a culture from the cervix at 35-37 weeks gestation,Obtaining cultures from the cervix and rectum at 35-37 weeks gestation,Obtaining cultures from the rectum and vaginal introitus at 35-37 weeks gestation,,5,The gastrointestinal tract is the most likely reservoir of group B Streptococcus with secondary spread to the genital tract. Cultures from the vaginal introitus and the rectum are the most sensitive for detecting colonization. No speculum examination is necessary. The closest time to delivery that cultures can be performed and allow time for results to be available is 35-37 weeks gestation. Culture-positive women are then treated during labor. Other criteria for the use of chemoprophylaxis during delivery continue to apply.,,

It should not be given to family members of immunocompromised patients. A history of egg allergy is a contraindication to its use. Allergic rhinitis is not a contraindication.,,
2010,5,Psychiatry,Which one of the following is a major advantage of second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics compared with first-generation antipsychotics? ,Less tardive dyskinesia,Less monitoring for major side effects,The availability of deport (intramuscular) formulations,Lower cost,Simpler dosing schedules,,1,"A recent expert consensus panel endorsed the use of second-generation antipsychotics rather than first-generation drugs. Tardive dyskinesia is much less common with the use of second-generation antipsychotics. Several of the second-generation drugs require monitoring for major side effects, however. For example, clozapine, shown by studies to be the most efficacious of the new class, causes granulocytopenia or agranulocytosis, requiring weekly and later biweekly monitoring of blood counts. Both classes have depot formulations for intramuscular administration every 2-4 weeks. Oral dosing of drugs from both classes varies from 1 to 3 times daily. First-generation antipsychotics cost less than second-generation drugs.",,
2011,1,Medicine,A 75 year old male has not seen a physician in 25 years and presents with advanced Parkinson's disease. The best initial treatment would be: ,Referral to a neurosurgeon for thalamotomy,Amantadine (Symmetrel),Benztropine (Cogentin),Pramipexole (Mirapex),Carbidopa/levodopa (Sinemet),,5,"While anticholinergics such as benztropine and amantadine may provide some improvement of symptoms, these effects wane within a few months. Such medications are not a good option in this patient with advanced disease.Dopamine agonists provide some improvements in motor complications, but are mainly used to delay the introduction of levodopa in younger patients, to avoid levodopa-related adverse reactions. Carbidopa/levodopa is better for initial therapy in older patients, and those who present with more severe symptoms. Slow-release versions of this combination may decrease motor fluctuations.Stereotactic thalamotomy is used to ameliorate tremors that have become disabling. This procedure has been replaced by other surgical options such as pallidotomy and high-frequency, deep-brain stimulation of specific nuclei.",,

Your are concerned that his visit to the emergency department may affect the results of prostate cancer screening, and you decide to obtain more information. Which one of the following possible occurrences 2 days earlier would not preclude prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening? ",Performance of a digital rectal exam for hemorrhoids,Performance of prostate exam,Performance of cystoscopy,A diagnosis of urinary tract infection,A diagnosis of urinary retention,,1,"Elevated results on prostrate-specific antigen (PSA) screening are associated with a variety of factors. A simple rectal examination, however, does not elevate the level.Benign prostatic examination is a frequent cause of mild elevations in PSA. Interventions such as prostatic massage or cystoscopy will also elevate the level. Other conditions that can elevate PSA include urinary tract infections and urinary retention.",,

Her menses occur approximately every 30 days and her next period is expected to occur in 1 week. Pelvic ultrasonography reveals a thin-walled simple cyst 5 cm in diameter. No other abnormalities are seen in the pelvic structures. Which one of the following is the best course of management for this condition? ",Reassurance only,Checking for any increase in adnexal fullness at her next annual physical examination,Repeat ultrasonography in 2-3 months to confirm resolution of the cyst,Referral for ultrasound guided aspiration of the cyst,Referral for laparoscopic removal of the cyst,,3,"Adnexal masses in women under 45 years of age are benign in 80%-85% of cases. The specific findings of this case also strongly suggest a benign etiology, namely a thin-walled, simple cyst, a lesion that is less than 8 cm in size, and a patient of relatively young age. No aggressive means are indicated in these situations unless there are significant clinical symptoms such as pain, abdominal pressure, urinary symptoms, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Most experts currently recommend a conservative approach with repeat ultrasonography in at least 2 months, during which time the vast majority of benign cysts resolve spontaneously.",,
2015,2,OBGYN,Which one of the following should be avoided in the treatment and prophylaxis of migraine during early pregnancy?,Calcium channel blockers,Beta-Blockers,Triptans,NSAIDs,,,3,"Headaches, and migraines in particular, are very common in women of childbearing age. Migraine sufferers usually have improvement of symptoms in pregnancy and many have complete remission. Most medications used for prophylaxis and abortive treatments of migraines in the nonpregnant patient can also be used in pregnant patients. Most Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers are safe. Acetaminophen and narcotics can be used for acute pain. Ibuprofen can also be used but should be avoided late in pregnancy because it is associated with premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and oligohydramnios. Ergotamines should be avoided as they are uterotonic and have abortifacient properties. They have also been associated with case reports of fetal birth defects. Triptans have the potential to cause vasoconstriction of the placental and uterine vessels and should be used only if the benefit clearly outweighs the harm.",,

A 2003 meta-analysis concluded that clozapine was the most efficacious second-generation antipsychotic, followed by risperidone and olanzapine. However, clozapine use is associated with an approximately 1% incidence of granulocytopenia or agranulocytosis. Early detection by monitoring blood counts every 1-2 weeks has led to a reduction in agranulocytosis-related death, but clozapine is generally considered second-line therapy, to be used in cases unresponsive to other drugs.",,

A number of symptoms are characteristic of both disorders, such as sleep disturbance, appetite changes, difficulty concentrating, irritability, fatigue, thoughts of suicide or death, and nonspecific gastrointestinal or cardiac complaints. Features that are more characteristic of anxiety include difficulty falling asleep, apprehensive expectations or feelings of dread, tremors or palpitations, phobic avoidance behavior, rapid pulse and other autonomic hyperactivity, breathing disturbances, sweating spells, feeling faint or dizzy, depersonalization (feelings of detachment from one's body), or derealization (a sensation that the immediate environment is unreal or unfamiliar). Findings more characteristic of depression include early morning awakening, diurnal variation (feeling worse in the mornings), sad and downcast facial expressions, psychomotor retardation (slowed speech, slowed thought processes), chronic unexplained pain, sadness, feeling guilty, hopelessness, feelings of worthlessness, despair, loss of interest in usual activities, anhedonia (inability to experience pleasure), and difficulty in making decisions.",,

Which one of the following would be considered first-line therapy for this condition? ",Oral tetracycline,Oral isotretinoin (Accutane),Topical sulfacetamide (Sulamyd),Topical benzoyl peroxide,,,4,"The Academy of Dermatology grades acne as mild, moderate, and severe. Mild acne is limited to a few to several papules and pustules without any nodules. Patients with moderate acne have several to many papules and pustules with a few to several nodules. Patients with severe acne have many or extensive papules, pustules, and nodules.The patient has mild acne according to the Academy of Dermatology classification scheme. Topical treatments including benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, and topical antibiotics are useful first-line agents in mild acne. Topical sulfacetamide is not considered first-line therapy for mild acne. Oral antibiotics are used in mild acne where there is inadequate response to topical agents and as first-line therapy in more severe acne. Caution must be used to avoid tetracycline in pregnant females. Oral isotetinoin is used in severe nodular acne, but also must be used with extreme caution in females who may become pregnant.

Patients who were stratified to the rhythm control arm of the trials did NOT have a morbidity or mortality benefit and were more likely to suffer from adverse drug effects and increased hospitalizations. The most efficacious drugs for rate control are calcium channel blockers and Beta-blockers. Digoxin is less effective for rate control and should be reserved as an add-on option for those not controlled with a Beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker, or for patients with significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction.In patients 65 years of age or older or with one of more risk factors for stroke, the best choice for anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic disease is warfarin. Of note, in patients who are successfully rhythm controlled and maintained in sinus rhythm, the thromboembolic rate is equivalent to those managed with a rate control strategy. Thus, the data suggest that patients who choose a rhythm control strategy should be maintained on anticoagulation regardless of whether they are consistently in sinus rhythm.",,

In patients in whom the clinical diagnosis was uncertain, sensitivity was 92% and specificity was 85%. Two prospective studies comparing ultrasonography with spiral CT have favored spiral CT. Ultrasonography is used in women who are pregnant and women in whom there is a high degree of suspicion of gynecologic disease. Abdominal radiography has low specificity and sensitivity for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Air contrast barium enema also has low accuracy. Limitations of MRI include increased cost, decreased availability, and increased examination time compared to CT.",,

This fracture is important to diagnose and treat appropriately because of a high rate of non-union. If radiographs are negative, the patient should be placed in a thumb spica splint and have repeat radiographs in 2 weeks, because initial studies may be negative. An Ace bandage or a sugar tong splint would be inappropriate because they do not immobilize the thumb. A long arm cast for 8 weeks would immobilize the thumb, but could lead to loss of function, and may overtreat the injury if it is not truly a scaphoid fracture.",,

This is consistent with a grade III envenomation and merits antivenin therapy. Production of equine-derived antivenin has stopped, but may still be indicated where available. The ovine product, CroFab, is less allergenic but still scarce due to limited production.Venom extractors are thought to be useful only in the first few minutes after a bite. Two hours is too late to be of any use. Tourniquets are thought to be contraindicated when used to compress an artery. Low-pressure constriction of lymphatic and venous vessels is controversial. Fasciotomy has not proved useful. Antivenin is indicated before any consideration of compartment syndrome. Pressure measurements would be required because of the clinical similarities between envenomation injury and compartment syndrome. Coagulation factors and blood products are rapidly inactivated. They are indicated only in the presence of exsanguinations.",,

The radial nerve controls extension of the thumb and fingers. The median nerve partially controls flexion of the wrist, but the site of innervation is proximal to the wound site at the base of the thumb. Abduction of the thumb is a function of the radial nerve.

",All family members may use an antimotility agent such as loperamide (Imodium) for mild disease,"Most cases of traveler's diarrhea are caused by parasites, so antibiotics are ineffective",Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) is indicated for treatment of any family member with dysenteric diarrhea,"Prophylactic antibiotic treatment should being 2 days before leaving, and should be continued until 1 week after returning home",,,1,"Traveler's diarrhea may be caused by any of several bacteria, viruses, or, less commonly, parasites. However, enterotoxigenic E. coli is most common. The mainstay of treatment is fluid replacement and an antimotility agent such as loperamide or diphenoxylate is preferred. Antimotility agents are contraindicated in patients with fever or bloody stools and in children &lt; 2 yr. Generally, antibiotics are not necessary for mild diarrhea. In patients with moderate to severe diarrhea (&ge; 3 loose stools over 8 h), antibiotics are given, especially if vomiting, abdominal cramps, fever, or bloody stools are present. For adults, ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin is recommended. For children azithromycin is preferred. Prevention:Travelers should dine at restaurants with a reputation for safety and avoid foods and beverages from street vendors. They should consume only cooked foods that are still steaming hot, fruit that can be peeled, and carbonated beverages without ice served in sealed bottles (bottles of noncarbonated beverages can contain tap water added by unscrupulous vendors); uncooked vegetables should be avoided. Buffets and fast food restaurants pose an increased risk.Prophylactic antibiotics are effective in preventing diarrhea, but because of concerns about adverse effects and development of resistance, they should probably be reserved for immunocompromised patients.

Valproic acid is FDA-approved for the treatment of manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder. It has been shown in controlled studies to be significantly more effective than placebo. The initial dosage is 750 mg daily given in divided doses, and most individuals require between 1000 and 2500 mg daily. Carbamazepine has also been used to treat mania and is an alternative for individuals who cannot tolerate lithium or valproic acid.

It is common and self-limited, and represents a physiologic process of spitting up. GER occurs in the absence of poor weight gain, irritability, cough, pain, or anemia. The majority of infants with GER are thriving. It is important to consider other systemic disorders, and rule them out when appropriate. Possible causes of spitting up include pyloric stenosis, infections (e.g., gastrointestinal, genitourinary), and metabolic disorders. It is not necessary to perform a diagnostic evaluation prior to starting drug therapy unless a structural defect is highly suspected. GER in infants is usually self-limited and resolves by 1 year of age.",,

You discuss various options including the vaginal contraceptive ring (NuvaRing), and she asks for more information. Which one of the following is true regarding the advantages and disadvantages of this form of contraception? ",It protects against sexually transmitted diseases,"To assure maximum contraceptive protection, it should be replaced every 3 months",It is associated with a higher incidence of breakthrough bleeding than levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol pills,Up to 50% of women have significant difficulty inserting the device correctly,"If the device is expelled from the vagina for more than 3 hours, backup contraception should be used temporarily",,5,"The vaginal ring works by releasing etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol intravaginally (etonogestrel is a progestin and ethinyl estradiol is an estrogen). Because it is not a barrier method of contraception, it does not protect against STDs. It is currently recommended that the ring be left in place for 3 weeks and then removed for 1 week so that withdrawal bleeding occurs. A new ring is then inserted. The vaginal ring has a lower incidence of breakthrough bleeding than levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradoil oral contraceptives. In a 1-year study, the majority of women who used the vaginal ring considered insertion and removal of the device easy, and 90% used the device correctly. If for some reason the ring is out of the vagina for more than 3 hours, back-up contraception should be used until the device has been back in place for 7 days.",,
2053,3,PMCH,"A case of meningococcal meningitis has just been confirmed at a day-care center. The susceptibility of the microorganism is not yet known. At this point, you should do which one of the following for the day-care center contacts? ",Culture their nasopharyngeal secretions,Administer meningococcal vaccine,Prescribe sulfadiazine,Prescribe chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin),Prescribe rifampin (Rifadin),,5,"Rifampin, in the absence of major contraindications, is the drug of choice for preventing the spread of meningococcal disease when the susceptibility of the organism is not known. In this situation, meningococcal vaccines are of no value because their protective effects take a few days to develop, and because they do not protect against group B meningococci, the most prevalent strain for meningococcal disease. Silfadiazine is the drug of choice if the meningococcus is known to be susceptible to it. Chloramphenicol and penicillin, which are effective in treating the disease, are ineffective in eliminating nasopharyngeal carriers of meningococci, possibly because they do not appear in high concentrations in saliva. Culturing contacts for meningococcal carriage in the nasopharynx has no value for identifying those at risk for meningococcal disease.",,

Anatomic abnormalities, however, are the most frequent cause of constant unilateral obstruction. Of these, septal deviation is the most common. Foreign body impaction is an important, but infrequent, cause of unilateral obstruction and purulent rhinorrhea. Mucosal disease is usually bilateral and intermittent. Adenoidal hypertrophy is the most common tumor or growth to cause nasal obstruction, followed by nasal polyps, but both are less frequent than true anatomic causes of constant obstruction.",,

The mother states that the child began to have diarrhea as soon as she began giving him various grain cereals and baby foods 5 months ago. The remainder of a review of systems and a social and family history is unremarkable. Physical examination reveals an undernourished infant with mild abdominal distention. A check of the infant's hemoglobin shows a microcytic anemia with a low serum ferritin level. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ",Thalassemia,Celiac sprue,Cystic fibrosis,Congenital megacolon (Hirschsprung's disease),Inborn error of metabolism,,2,"Celiac sprue is a condition of acquired malabsorption that resolves when the patient is exposed to a gluten-free diet. Gluten is a substance found in wheat, rye, and barley, but not in corn or rice products. Children with this sensitivity will develop inflammation and destruction of the microvilli in the small intestine as a result of an immune response to gluten. Patients with celiac sprue often present as this child has, between 4 and 24 months of age with impaired growth, diarrhea, and abdominal distention. An iron deficiency anemia can occur with impairment of iron absorption from the small intestine. Lesser cases of malabsorption are common, and this condition often goes unrecognized into adolescence or adulthood. Serologic tests, and ultimately a biopsy of the small intestine, can confirm the diagnosis.",,

Imiquimod, podophyllin, and podofilox are not recommended for use during pregnancy. For the treatment of vaginal warts, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of cryotherapy. Liquid nitrogen, rather than a cryoprobe, should be used to avoid possible vaginal perforation and subsequent fistula formation. An alternative is the use of trichloroacetic acid or bichloroacetic acid carefully applied to the lesions to avoid damage to adjacent tissue. Interferon is no longer recommended for routine use in treating genital warts, due to a high frequency of systemic adverse effects.",,

","Warm sitz baths, a high-residue diet, and NSAIDs",Rubber band ligation of the hemorrhoid,Elliptical excision of the thrombosed hemorrhoid,"Stool softeners and a topical analgesic/hydrocortisone cream (e.g., Anusol-HC)",,,3,"The appropriate management of a thrombosed hemorrhoid presenting within 48 hours of onset of symptoms is an elliptical excision of the hemorrhoid and overlying skin under local anesthesia (i.e., 0.5% bupivacaine hydrochloride [Marcaine] in 1:200,000 epinephrine) infiltrated slowly with a small (27 gauge) needle for patient comfort.Incision and clot removal may provide inadequate drainage with rehemorrhage and clot reaccumulation. Most thrombosed hemorrhoids contain multiocular clots which may not be accessible through a simple incision. Rubber band ligation is an excellent technique for management of internal hemorrhoids. Banding an external hemorrhoid would cause exquisite pain.When pain is already subsiding or more time has elapsed (in the absence of necrosis or ulceration) measures such as sitz baths, bulk laxatives, stool softeners, and local analgesia may all be helpful. Some local anesthetics carry the risk of sensitization, however. Counseling to avoid precipitating factors (e.g., prolonged standing/sitting, constipation, delay of defecation) is also appropriate.",,

",Total lung capacity,Vital capacity,Resting PaO2 arterial tension,Functional residual capacity,One-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1),,4,"Although vital capacity declines with age, total lung capacity remains constant. The reduction in vital capacity results from an increase in residual volume. This increase in residual volume and functional residual capacity results from the collapse of small airways that occurs at higher lung volumes as age increases. Residual volume increases nearly 50% between early adulthood and age 70. In addition, standard spirometric measurements of lung function (i.e., forced expiratory volume in 1 second, peak expiratory flow rate, and maximal expiratory flow volume) have been shown to decline with age.

2063,1,Medicine,A healthy 40 year old female presents for her annual gynecologic examination. She tells you that she also needs a tuberculin screening test for her anticipated volunteer work at the local hospital. She has had no significant illness or exposures and has been your patient for nearly 20 years. You administer a PPD test which shows 10 mm of induration on the second day. The most appropriate next step in her evaluation would be: ,A repeat PPD in 2 weeks,A chest radiograph (two views),Screening liver function tests,Isoniazid (INH) for 9 months for treatment of her latent tuberculosis,,,1,"The Thoracic Society and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advocated a shift in focus from screening the general population to testing only patients at increased risk for developing tuberculosis. In some persons PPD reactivity wanes with time but can be recalled by a second skin test administered 1 week or more after the first (i.e., two-step testing). For persons undergoing PPD skin testing, such as health-care workers, initial two-step testing may preclude misclassification of persons with boosted reactions as PPD converters. In those at low risk, such as this patient, a tuberculin skin test is now considered positive only if induration is at least 15 mm. Thus, this hospital volunteer would pose little risk to the hospital population since her 10-mm reaction falls within the guidelines of a negative test. She does not require diagnostic evaluation at this time, and isoniazid therapy is not indicated.",,

Suicide rates increase with age and are higher among men. Increased suicide rates also occur in patients with significant medical illnesses. Because discussing suicidal ideation may relieve the patient's anxiety, the physician should directly ask depressed patients about any suicidal thoughts. There are no known reliable tools for assessing suicide risk, so the assessment is subjective, The initial management of suicidal ideation should establish safety, often by hospitalization. The suicide prevention contract is of unproven clinical and legal usefulness. Antidepressant medication has not been shown to reduce suicide rates, especially on a short-term basis.",,

So-called false labor, or Braxton Hicks contractions, consists of weak, irregular, regional contractions that usually occur for weeks before the onset of actual labor and abate with time, analgesia and sedation. Spontaneous chorioamnionic membrane rupture precedes the onset of labor in about 10% of pregnancies, and amniotic fluid leaks through the cervix and out the vagina.The second stage of labor is defined as the period from complete cervix dilation to complete delivery of the baby. When the cervix is completely dilated, the patient usually experiences the urge to push with contractions.

Bence-Jones protein is seen in 80% of cases, but is typically absent in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Unlike in multiple myeloma, lytic bone lesions are not seen, and marrow biopsy reveals mostly lymphocytes. Sarcoidosis usually presents with hilar lymphadenopathy and a polyclonal gammopathy. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presents with similar symptoms, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly, but generally lacks a monoclonal gammopathy and Bence-Jones proteinemia, and has distinctive malignant lymphocytes on bone marrow biopsy.",,
2074,2,OBGYN,Which one of the following is true concerning nausea and vomiting in pregnancy?,Psychological factors play a causative role,"Pharmacologic therapy, in general, is no more effective than placebo in relieving symptoms and preventing hospitalization",Metoclopramide (Reglan) is contraindicated in the first trimester but is safe and effective for nausea and vomiting in later trimesters,"If nausea and vomiting began after 9 weeks gestation, secondary causes are more likely to be presented",,,4,"While the exact etiology of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy remains unclear, there are few data to support the theory that psychological factors play a role. Although nausea is usually self-limited condition, other causes must be ruled out. Secondary causes are more likely to be present if the onset of symptoms occurs after 9 weeks gestation. Several pharmacologic treatments are proven safe and are superior to placebo in relieving symptoms and preventing hospitalization. Metoclopramide is more effective than placebo and has not been associated with an increased risk of adverse effects on the fetus.",,
2075,4,Pediatrics,A 12 year old male middle-school wrestler comes to your office complaining of a recurrent painful rash on his arm. There appear to be several dry vesicles. The most likely diagnosis is which of the following? ,Molluscum contagiosum,Human papillomavirus,Herpes gladiatorum,Tinea corporis,Mat burn,,3,"The most common infection transmitted person-to-person in wrestlers is herpes gladiatorum caused by the herpes simplex virus. Molluscum contagiosum causes keratinized plugs. Human papillomavirus causes warts. Tinea corporis is ringworm, which is manifested by round to oval raised areas with central clearing. Mat burn is an abrasion.",,
2076,3,PMCH,"In a patient with atrial fibrillation, which one of the following confers the greatest risk for stroke?",Age over 75,Diabetes mellitus,Previous history of stroke,Congestive heart failure,Hypertension,,3,"It is well established that atrial fibrillation is associated with a heightened risk of stroke. Anticoagulant therapy is not without risk, and for this reason a risk-scoring system has been developed to aid the clinician in deciding on therapy. Points are assigned using the acronym CHADS2. One point each is given for a history of Congestive heart failure, Hypertension (both treated and untreated), Age greater than 75, and Diabetes mellitus, and 2 points for a previous history of Stroke or TIA.",,
2077,1,Medicine,"In a patient with HIV infection, the threshold for initiating treatment for tuberculosis after PPD screening is induration greater than or equal to: ",2.5 mm,5.0 mm,7.5 mm,10 mm,15 mm,,2,Treatment should be initiated when a PPD causes induration  5 mm in a patient with HIV infection.,,
2078,4,Pediatrics,Which one of the following historical features is most suggestive of congestive heart failure in a 6-month-old white male presenting with tachypnea? ,Diaphoresis with feeding,Fever,Nasal congestion,Noisy respiration or wheezing,Staccato cough,,1,"Symptoms of congestive heart failure in infants are often related to feedings. Only small feedings may be tolerated, and dyspnea may develop with feedings. Profuse perspiration with feedings is characteristic, and is related to adrenergic drive. Older children may have symptoms more similar to adults, but the infant's greatest exertion is related to feeding.Fever and nasal congestion are more suggestive of infectious problems. Noisy respiration or wheezing does not distinguish between congestive heart failure, asthma, and infectious processes. A staccato cough is more suggestive of an infectious process, including pertussis. ",,
2079,1,Medicine,Which one of the following should be avoided when managing chronic pain in elderly nursing-home patients? ,Acetaminophen,Propoxyphene (Darvon),Hydrocodone (Lortab),Oxycodone (OxyContin),Hydromorphone (Dilaudid),,2,"According to the Geriatrics Society, propoxyphene is not recommended for persistent mild to moderate pain. Studies suggest that its efficacy is similar to that of aspirin or acetaminophen alone, but drug accumulation, neuroexcitatory effects, and ataxia or dizziness may add unnecessary morbidity in older patients. Other analgesic strategies are considered more appropriate for patients with persistent mild to moderate pain. Acetaminophen, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and hydromorphone are options for treating chronic pain of varying degrees of severity.",,
2081,5,Psychiatry,"A 25 year old male visits your office for follow-up 3 weeks after beginning fluoxetine (Prozac) for newly diagnosed major depression. He has experienced gastrointestinal discomfort, increased agitation, worsening insomnia, and sexual dysfunction since beginning the drug. Together you agree to discontinue fluoxetine and begin a different medication. Which one of the following would be the best choice to avoid agitation and sexual dysfunction? ",Bupropion (Wellbutrin),Clonazepam (Klonopin),Sertraline (Zoloft),Mirtazapine (Remeron),Venlafaxine (Effexor),,4,"Many patients stop taking antidepressants within the first month of therapy, often citing side effects as the reason. Fluoxetine, an SSRI, is frequently associated with gastrointestinal irritation, sexual side effects, and agitation. Sertraline is an SSRI with a similar side-effect profile. Bupropion does not have the sexual side effects of the SSRIs but can cause significant agitation. Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine and likely would not cause many of this patient's side effects, but is not appropriate as the primary treatment for major depression. The mechanism of action for venlafaxine includes both serotonin and epinephrine reuptake inhibition, and it can cause some of the same symptoms as the SSRIs. Mirtazapine, however, would help this patient sleep, usually does not cause appetite suppression, and infrequently causes sexual disturbance.",,
2082,1,Medicine,A 19 year old female runner has a 1-week history of constant groin pain. There is limited hip motion on flexion and internal rotation of the right hip. Radiographs of the hip and pelvis are normal. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ,Iliotibial band syndrome,Stress fracture of the right femoral neck,Osteitis pubis,Pelvic inflammatory disease,,,2,"Stress fractures of the femoral neck are most commonly seen in military recruits and runners. They present with persistent groin pain, and limited hip flexion and internal rotation. Radiographs may be normal early. Iliotibial band syndrome also occurs in runners and presents with stinging pain over the lateral femoral epicondyle. Osteitis pubis occurs in distance runners and presents with pain in the anterior pelvic area and tenderness over the symphysis pubis. Pelvic inflammatory disease is associated with abdominal pain and fever.",,
2083,2,OBGYN,Uterine rupture is a potential complication of attempted vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC). The most reliable indication that uterine rupture may have occurred is ,Cessation of uterine contractions during active labor,Fetal bradycardia,Vaginal bleeding,Sudden lower abdominal pain,Maternal hypotension,,2,"Uterine rupture occurs in 0.2%-1.0% of women in labor after one previous low transverse cesarean section. Obviously, this can have devastating consequences for the mother and baby, so vigilance during labor is paramount. Uterine pain, cessation of contractions, vaginal bleeding, failure of labor to progress, or fetal regression may occur, but none of these are as consistent as fetal bradycardia in cases of uterine rupture during labor for VBAC patients.",,
2084,6,Surgery,A 55 year old white male smoker has had daily severe gastroesophageal reflux symptoms unrelieved by intensive medical therapy with proton pump inhibitors. A recent biopsy performed during upper endoscopy identified Barrett's esophagus. Which one of the following is true about this condition? ,It will regress after antireflux surgery,It will regress following esophageal dilation,It will regress after Heliobacter pylori treatment,It is associated with an increased risk of adenocarcinoma,,,4,"Barrett's esophagus is an acquired intestinal metaplasia of the distal esophagus associated with longstanding gastroesophageal acid reflux, although a quarter of patients with Barrett's esophagus have no reflux symptoms. It is more common in white and Hispanic men over 50 with longstanding severe reflux symptoms, and possible risk factors include obesity and tobacco use. It is a risk factor for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, with a rate of about one case in every 200 patients with Barrett's esophagus per year. Treatment is directed at reducing reflux, thus reducing symptoms. Neither medical nor surgical treatment has been shown to reduce the carcinoma risk. One reasonable screening suggestion is to perform esophagoduodenoscopy in all men over 50 with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), but these recommendations are based only on expert opinion (level C evidence), and no outcomes-based guidelines are available.",,
2085,6,Surgery,"A 14 year old black female presents for a routine evaluation. On examination, you note a rubbery, well-defined, nontender breast mass approximately 2 cm in diameter. The patient denies any history of breast tenderness, nipple discharge, or skin changes. The most likely diagnosis is ",Fibrocystic breast disease,Fibroadenoma,Benign breast cyst,Cystosarcoma phyllodes,Intraductal papilloma,,2,"Most breast masses in adolescent girls are benign. Fibroadenoma is the most common, accounting for approximately two-thirds of all adolescent breast masses. It is characterized by a slow growing, nontender, rubbery, well-defined mass, most commonly located in the upper, outer quadrant. Size varies, and is most commonly in the range of 2-3 cm. Fibrocystic disease is found in older adolescents and is characterized by bilateral nodularity and cyclic tenderness. Benign breast cysts are characterized by a spongy, tender mass with symptoms exacerbated by menses. Cysts are frequently multiple, and spontaneous regression occurs in 50% of patients. Cystosarcoma phyllodes is a rare tumor with malignant potential, although most are benign. It presents as a firm, rubbery mass the may enlarge rapidly. Skin necrosis is usually associated with the tumor,. Intraductal papullomas are usually benign but do have malignant potential. They are commonly subareolar and are associated with nipple discharge. These tumors are rare in the adolescent population.",,
2086,6,Surgery,"A 25 year old white female comes to your office complaining of abdominal pain. She requests that you hospitalize her and do whatever is necessary to get rid of the pain that has been present for a number of years. She has difficulty describing the pain. She is a single parent, and becomes defensive when asked about her previous marriage, stating only that her former husband is an alcoholic, just like my father.Her previous medical history includes an appendectomy, a cholecystectomy, and a hysterectomy. On physical examination she appears healthy and a CBC, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum amylase level, serum electrolyte levels, and multiple chemical profile are all normal. Management of this patient should include which one of the following? ",Long-term use of antidepressants,Referral to a surgeon for exploratory laparotomy,Informing her that her problems are psychogenic and that there is nothing to worry about,"Hospitalization as requested, then consultation with a psychiatrist","Scheduling frequent, regular office visits",,5,"Somatoform disorder is often encountered in family practice. Studies have documented that 5% of patients meet the criteria for somatization disorder, while another 4% have borderline somatization disorder. Most of these patients are female and have a low socioeconomic status. They have a high utilization of medical services, usually reflected by a thick medical chart, and are often single parents. As a rule, physicians tend to be less satisfied with the care rendered to these patients as opposed to those without the disorder. Patients with multiple unexplained physical symptoms have been described as functionally disabled, spending an average of one week per month in bed. Many of these patients seek and are ultimately granted surgical procedures, and it is not uncommon for them to have multiple procedures, especially involving the pelvic area. Often there are associated psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, depression, suicidal threats, alcohol or drug abuse, interpersonal or occupational difficulties, and antisocial behavior. A background of a dysfunctional family unit in which one or both parents abused alcohol or drugs or were somatically preoccupied is also quite common. Unfortunately, these individuals tend to marry alcohol abusers, and thus continue the pattern of dysfunctional family life. Treatment of somatoform disorder should be by one primary physician where an established relationship and regular visits can curtail the dramatic symptoms that many times lead to hospitalization. The family physician is in a position to monitor family dynamics and provide direction on such issues as alcoholism and child abuse. Each office visit should be accompanied by a physical examination, and the temptation to tell the patient that the problem is not physical should be avoided. Knowing the patient well helps to avoid unnecessary hospitalization, diagnostic procedures, surgery, and laboratory tests. These should be done only if clearly indicated. Psychotrophic medications should be avoided except when clearly indicated, as medications reinforce the sick role, may be abused, and may be used for suicidal gestures.",,
2087,2,OBGYN,The probability of pregnancy after unprotected intercourse is the highest at which one of the following times?,3 days before ovulation,1 day before ovulation,The day of ovulation,1 day after ovulation,3 days after ovulation,,2,"There is a 30% probability of pregnancy resulting from unprotected intercourse 1 or 2 days before ovulation, 15% 3 days before, 12% the day of ovulation, and essentially 0% 1-2 days after ovulation. Knowing the time of ovulation therefore has implications not only for natural family planning, but also for decisions regarding postcoital contraception.",,
2088,5,Psychiatry,"A 50 year old female with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation has been successfully treated for depression with sertraline (Zoloft). However, she has persistent insomnia, and a 10-day trial of zolpidem (Ambien) has yielded minimal improvement. The most appropriate addition to her current medication would be ",Trazodone (Desyrel) each evening,Lorazepam (Ativan) daily,Zaleplon (Sonata) at night,Amitriptyline (Elavil) at night,,,1,"Trazodone has been found useful for its sedative and hypnotic effects, and is often used in combination with another antidepressant. Benzodiazepines are not recommended for long-term use. Zaleplon is more short-acting than zolpiden and therefore would not be more effective. Amitriptyline could be used for its antidepressant and sedative effects, but its chronotropic side effects make it less preferable for someone with a disposition to cardiac arrhythmia.",,
2090,2,OBGYN,Which one of the following is true regarding the use of a diaphragm for contraception?,It must be refitted if the patient gains more than 15 lb,Use of nonoxynol-9 will prevent HIV,Diaphragms are made only of latex,Diaphragms are recommended for women with a history of toxic shock syndrome,The diaphragm should be removed immediately after intercourse,,1,"The diaphragm is an effective method of contraception if used correctly. A weight change of more than 15 lb, pregnancy, or pelvic surgery may necessitate refitting. If used with nonoxynol-9, a diaphragm may actually increase the risk of HIV transmission. Diaphragms are made of latex, but a wide seal rim model made of silicon is available for those who are latex sensitive. Diaphragm use is contraindicated in women with a history of toxic shock syndrome. The diaphragm should remain in place for 6-24 hours after intercourse.",,
2091,6,Surgery,"A 70 year old white female with osteoporosis sees you for follow-up a few days after an emergency department visit for an acute T12 vertebral compression fracture. The fracture was suspected clinically and on plain films; the diagnosis was confirmed with a bone scan. The emergency department physician prescribed oxycodone (OxyContin) and NSAIDs, but the patient is still experiencing considerable discomfort. In addition to increasing the dosage of oxycodone, which one of the following interventions would you suggest now to reduce the patient's pain? ",Calcitonin (Miacalcin),Raloxifene (Evista),Alendronate (Fosamax),"Physical therapy, including dexamethasone iontophoresis",Vertebroplasty,,1,"Calcitonin, either intranasal or subcutaneous, provides pain relief within a few days in many patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. The remainder of the choices do not provide acute pain relief. Vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty procedures are generally reserved for cases in which medical management has failed.",,
2092,4,Pediatrics,"While seeing a 6 month old infant for a well-child check, you note that his height is at the 50th percentile, and his weight is at the 5th percentile. You are concerned about the possibility of failure to thrive (FTT). You history and physical examination reveal no obvious cause for FTT other than inadequate caloric intake due to poor parental skills. Which one of the following would be the most likely result of laboratory evaluation of this child? ",Anemia,Hypoglycemia,Hypothyroidism,Hyponatremia,No abnormalities,,5,"The majority of children with failure to thrive (FTT) have no laboratory abnormalities. In a classic study of children hospitalized with FTT, only 1.4% of laboratory tests were of diagnostic significance. A practical approach is not to order any laboratory tests initially unless suggested by the history or physical examination. Screening laboratory studies can be considered in children who fail to respond to nutritional intervention.",,
2093,1,Medicine,Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who have episodic symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation benefit most from: ,Episodic intravenous digoxin,Long-term oral digitalis,Episodic Beta-blockers,Radiofrequency catheter ablation of bypass tracts,,,4,"Radiofrequency catheter ablation of bypass tracts is possible in over 90% of patients and is safer and more cost effective than surgery, with a similar success rate. Intravenous and oral digoxin can shorten the refractory period of the accessory pathway, and increase the ventricular rate, causing ventricular fibrillation. Beta-blockers will not control the ventricular response during atrial fibrillation when conduction proceeds over the bypass tract.",,

ASC is divided into atypical squamous cells  cannot exclude HSIL (ASC-H) and atypical squamous cells of unknown signifiance (ASC-US). ASCUS-favor reactive has been downgraded to negative in the system. Atypical glandular cells of unknown significance (AGUS) has been replaced by atypical glandular cells (AGC).",,
2096,6,Surgery,A moderately obese 50 year old female presents with colicky right upper quadrant pain that radiates to her right shoulder. Which one of the following is considered the best study to confirm the likely cause of the patient's symptoms? ,Plain abdominal radiography,Oral cholecystography,Abdominal ultrasonography,A barium swallow,Esophagogastroscopy,,3,"The symptom complex presented is typical of cholelithiasis. Plain radiography of the abdomen may reveal radiopaque gallstones, but will not reveal radiolucent tones or biliary dilation. Although rarely used, oral cholecystography is 98% accurate, but only when compliance is assured, the contrast agent is absorbed, and liver function is normal. Abdominal ultrasonography is considered the best study to confirm this diagnosis because of its high sensitivity and its accuracy in detecting gallstones. A barium swallow will identify some functional and structural esophageal abnormalities, but will not focus on the suspected organ in this case. The same is true of esophagoastroscopy.",,

2098,1,Medicine,A 62 year old female with numbness in the lower extremities and macrocytosis has a normal serum folate level and a serum B12 level of 200 pg/mL (N 150-800). Which one of the following laboratory findings would confirm the diagnosis of B12 deficiency? ,Elevated angiotensin converting enzyme,Elevated methylmalonic acid,Elevated free erythrocyte protoporphyrin,Low haptoglobin,Low homocysteine,,2,"This patient has several clinical features of vitamin B12 deficiency. Some patients with significant vitamin B12 deficiency have levels in the lower range of normal, as this patient does. Vitamin B12 is a cofactor in the synthesis of both methionin and succinyl coenzyme A, and vitamin B12 deficiency leads to the accumulation of methylmalonic acid and homocysteine, which are the precursors of these compounds. An elevated level of these substances is therefore more sensitive than a low vitamin B12 level for vitamin B12 deficiency. Homocysteine is also elevated in folic acid deficiency, however, a methylmalonic acid level is recommended if vitamin B12 deficiency is a concern and serum vitamin B12 levels are 150-400 pg/mL. A reduced haptoglobin level is useful to confirm hemolytic anemia. An elevated free erythrocyte protoporphyrin level may occur in lead poisoning or iron deficiency. An elevated angiotension converting enzyme level is found in sarcoidosis.",,

The most appropriate plan would include which one of the following? ,Mammograms for female students,Lead poisoning screening for all students,Stool occult blood kits,Smoking cessation programs,An annual routine physical examination for all students,,4,The Preventive Services Task Force recommends a routine physical examination every 3-5 years for young adults until the age of 40. Mammograms are not recommended until age 40. Lead screening is recommended for at-risk individuals between 6 months and 6 years of age. Colorectal cancer screening for average-risk individuals is recommended at age 50. Counseling on tobacco use and other substance abuse is recommended at age 50. Counseling on tobacco use and other substance abuse is recommended as part of all routine preventive care.,,

There is no family history of breast cancer. The patient is concerned about her future and current health and wants to know the benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Which one of the following statements about HRT is correct? ",It lowers risk of invasive breast cancer,It slows progression of Alzheimer's disease,It improves symptoms of depression,It improves vaginal dryness,It improves urinary incontinence,,4,"Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) improves the urogenital symptoms of menopause, such as vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. However, recent research regarding HRT has not shown a benefit for reducing coronary events, slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease, improving depression, or improving urinary incontinence. It does not decrease risk of invasive breast cancer. ",,
2103,5,Psychiatry,"Children of an elderly man who suffers from Alzheimer's disease are bothered by his wandering and pacing behaviors. You have started treatment with a cholinesterase inhibitor, but the behavior persists. They ask you to prescribe additional drug therapy. You would recommend which one of the following? ",No additional drug therapy,Risperidone (Risperdal),Citalopram (Celexa),Lorazepam (Ativan),Valproic acid (Depakote),,1,"Behavioral symptoms such as agitation and wandering become common as Alzheimer's disease progresses. Cholinesterase inhibitors may improve some of these symptoms. If they persist, use of a psychotropic agent may be necessary. Atypical agents can help control problematic delusions, hallucinations, severe psychomotor agitation, and combativeness. Typical agents help control these same problems, but are used more as second-line therapy in those who do not respond to atypical agents. Mood-stabilizing drugs can help control these symptoms as well, and may also be useful alternatives to antipsychotic agents for controlling severe agitated, repetitive, and combative behaviors. Benzodiazepines are used to manage insomnia, anxiety, and agitation. Some behaviors, such as wandering and pacing, are not amenable to drug therapy.",,
2104,4,Pediatrics,A 12 year old female is brought to your office because of the recent onset of a white vaginal discharge. She is otherwise asymptomatic and has never menstruated. She denies sexual activity and a general examination reveals no abnormalities. You note the presence of breast buds and scant pubic hair. Microscopic examination of the vaginal discharge shows sheets of vaginal epithelial cells. Which of the following is most likely in this setting? ,Pinworm (Enterobius vermicularis) infestation,Sexual abuse,Vaginal foreign body,Trichomoniasis,Physiologic secretions,,5,"This child is entering puberty. In the 6- to 12-month period before menarche, girls often develop a physiologic vaginal discharge to the increase in circulating estrogens. The gray-white discharge is non-irritating. When physiologic discharge is examined with the microscope, sheets of vaginal epithelial cells are seen. The only treatment necessary is reassurance of both patents and child that this is a normal process that will subside with time. The other conditions listed are pathologic and have other associated symptoms and findings not seen in this case. Pinworms normally cause perianal and vulvar pruritis and irritation. The findings in sexual abuse range from an inflamed vulvovaginal area, to evidence of sexually transmitted diseases, to evidence of local trauma. Trichomoniasis would cause vulvovaginal irritation and microscopic examination of the discharge would show Trichomonas organisms. A vaginal foreign body would usually present with a foul and/or bloody vaginal discharge.",,
2105,4,Pediatrics,"A 3 week old white male presents with a history of several days of projectile vomiting after feeding, and documented weight loss despite a good appetite. There is a questionable history of a paternal uncle having surgery for a similar problem when he was an infant. Which one of the following findings is a characteristic sign of this disease? ",Hypochloremic alkalosis,Pneumonia,Generalized abdominal distension,Currant jelly stool,Direct hyperbilirubinemia,,1,"Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is the most likely diagnosis in this case. If it is allowed to progress untreated, there may be signs of malnutrition, constipation, oliguria, and profound hypchloremic metabolic alkalosis. The latter is a characteristic sign of pyloric obstruction. As the child vomits chloride and hydrogen-rich gastric contents, hypochloremic alkalosis sets in. Pneumonia is not a common problem with pylori stenosis, as it can be with congenital tracheoesophageal fistulae for example. After feeding, there may be a visible peristaltic wave that progresses across the abdomen. However, since the point of obstruction is proximal to the small and large intestines and affected infants lose weight, the abdomen is usually flat rather than distended, especially in the malnourished infant. Currant jelly stool is a common clinical manifestation of intussusception. Mild jaundice with elevated indirect bilirubin is seen in about 5% of infants with pyloric stenosis, but is not a characteristic sign.",,

The combination of oral contraceptives and smoking substantially increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. In general, oral contraceptive use is considered absolutely contraindicated in women older than 35 who are heavy smokers. Women who smoke fewer than 15 cigarettes a day and patients with mildly elevated blood pressure and elevated lipid levels are not at increased risk for cardiovascular disease when oral contraceptives are used.",,

Since haloperidol is a dopamine antagonist and naloxone antagonizes opiods, both medications may aggravate symptoms of restless legs syndrome. The administration of magnesium has not been shown to be of benefit. While potentially useful for the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps, quinine has no role in the treatment of restless legs syndrome. ",,

She has had similar problems along with intermittent depression since she was a teenager. She admits to a loss of pleasure in work and recreational activities.Which one of the following is least likely to help her coexistant depressive symptoms? ,Paroxetine (Paxil),Venlafaxine (Effexor),Buspirone (BuSpar),Nortriptyline (Aventyl),Escitalopram (Lexapro),,3,"Buspirone is indicated for the treatment of anxiety. Its advantages include the absence of addictive potential and sedation: like antidepressants, the onset of benefit is often delayed for several weeks. However, it is not an established antidepressant. Its use with other agents for depression has yielded questionable benefit, and used alone it is not an effective therapy for depression.The other agents listed have both antidepressant and antianxiety effects and were originally marketed for their antidepressant effect. Nortriptyline shares the risks of tricyclic agents, but historically it was one of the better tolerated tricyclics. The newer agents have serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibition (SSRI activity).

",Social dysfunction,Incoherent speech,Elated mood,Loose associations,Auditory hallucations,,3,"Schizophrenia can be very difficult to definitively diagnose, and there are many subtypes. There are many sets of diagnostic criteria, but most, including DSM-IV, include the presence of thought disorders such as hallucinations, delusions, and loose associations; disorganized speech, catatonic behavior; and apathy or flat affect. (Two of these must be present to meet DSM-IV criteria). Additionally, there must be social or occupational impairment and a minimum duration of symptoms (6 months for DSM-IV). Mood disorders, including depression, mania, and schizoaffective disorder, must be excluded in order to diagnose schizophrenia.

",Systemic corticosteroids would be the initial treatment of choice if the child develops respiratory distress with his next sting,An antibiotic that covers Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus should be administered,The child is at high risk for a systemic reaction if he is stung again in the future,Skin tests are not helpful in confirming the presence of insect sting allergy,"If venom immunotherapy is begun, it should be stopped after 2 years of treatment",,3,"Children generally have a benign course after insect stings, but those with moderate to severe systemic reactions have a high risk of future reaction. Local reactions may initially look like cellulites, but antibiotic therapy is not needed.The treatment of choice for anaphylaxis subsequent to an insect sting is systemic epinephrine. Corticosteroids may be given as adjunctive treatment. Skin test using insect venom are used to confirm the presence of allergy in a patient who has had a clinical reaction to a sting, and to identify the specific insect(s) to which the patient is allergic.

",Supine,"Supine, with the uterus manually deflected laterally",Prone,Trendelenburg's position,Left lateral decubitus,,2,"In general, it is best to place a woman who is greater than 20 weeks pregnant in the left lateral decubitis position because the uterus can compress the great vessels, resulting in decreased systolic blood pressure and uterine blood flow.However, in the case of trauma where a spinal cord injury cannot be ruled out, the woman needs to be kept supine on a backboard. The weight of the uterus can be shifted off the great vessels by either manual deflection laterally or by elevating the right hip 4-6 inches by placing towels under the backboard. The Trendelenburg position does not relieve the weight of the uterus on the great vessels. The prone position does not provide adequate spinal cord protection, and would be extremely awkward in a large pregnant woman. ",,

If a pregnant woman is exposed to rubella, testing for rubella antibody should be performed as soon as possible. Positive rubella IgG antibody means that the patient is immune and not at risk. If serum IgG is not detectable, a second blood specimen should be obtained in 2-3 weeks; evidence of seroconversion indicates recent infection.The routine use of immune globulin for postexposure prophylaxis is not recommended, and it should be used only if pregnancy termination is not an option. Live-virus rubella vaccine may cross the placenta and infect the fetus, and therefore should not be given to pregnant women. Congenital rubella syndrome is most commonly associated with the following types of anomalies: ophthalmologic (cataracts, retinopathy, congenital glaucoma), cardiac (patent duct arteriosus, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis), auditory (sensorineural hearing impairment), and neurologic (behavioral disorders, meningoencephalitis, and mental retardation).

Examination reveals tenderness over the anatomic snuffbox and over the scaphoid tubercle at the proximal wrist crease with the hand in extension. Radiographs of the wrist are negative.Which one of the following would be the most appropriate action at this point? ,Order a bone scan for the next day,Order high-spatial-resolution ultrasonography of the wrist,Immobilize in a cast for 6-8 weeks,Immobilize in a thumb splint for 1-2 weeks and then order repeat radiographs,,,4,"Snuffbox tenderness and tenderness over the scaphoid tubercle are very sensitive for fracture of the scaphoid, but their specificity is only 40% and 60% respectively. Therefore, while the lack of tenderness at these sites almost rules out fracture, further imaging is needed in positive cases. Plain films are recommended as the next step.

",Cesarean section,Low Apgar scores ( 7),Maternal low backache 3 months post delivery,Prolonged second stage of labor,,,4,"Multiple systemic reviews have been conducted to examine effects of epidural anesthesia on maternal and neonatal outcomes. There are many confounding variables in the studies and, as a result, only a few effects of epidural anesthesia are consistently seen on a statistically significant basis: an increased duration of the second stage of labor, an increased rate of instrument-assisted vaginal deliveries, and an increased likelihood of maternal fever. Overall, there is no statistically significant difference in the duration of the first stage of labor, the incidence of low Apgar scores, or the incidence of maternal backache at 3 months or 12 months.

2692,1,Medicine,"A 77-year-old white male complains of urinary incontinence of more than one year's duration. The incontinence occurs with sudden urgency. No association with coughing or positional change has been noted. There is no history of fever or dysuria. One year ago he underwent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for benign prostatic hypertrophy and says his urinary stream has improved. Rectal examination reveals a smoothly enlarged prostate without nodularity, and normal sphincter tone. No residual urine is found post-void catherterization.Which one of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's incontinence? ",Detrusor instability,Urinary tract infection,Overflow,Fecal impaction,Recurrent bladder outlet obstruction,,1,"In elderly patients, detrusor instability is the most common cause of urinary incontinence in both men and women. Incontinence may actually become worse after surgical relief of obstructive prostatic hypertrophy. Infection is unlikely as the cause of persistent incontinence in this patient in the absence of fever or symptoms of urinary tract infection. Overflow is unlikely in the absence of residual urine. Impaction is a relatively rare cause of urinary incontinence, and associated findings would be present on rectal examination. Normalization of the urinary stream and the absence of residual urine reduce the likelihood of recurrent obstruction. The prostate would be expected to remain enlarged on rectal examination after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). ",,

",Explain that he must try to conform to be more popular,Explain that these symptoms are a stress reaction and will lessen with time,Explore whether his school counselor has a process to address this problem,Order a TSH level,,,3,"Childhood bullying has potentially serious implications for bullies and their targets. The target children are typically quiet and sensitive, and may be perceived to be weak and different. Children who say they are being bullied must be believed and reassured that they have done the right thing in acknowledging the problem. Parents should be advised to discuss the situation with school personnel. Bullying is extremely difficult to resolve. Confronting bullies and expecting victims to conform are not successful approaches. The presenting symptoms are not temporary, and in fact can progress to serious issues such as suicide, substance abuse, and victim-to-bully transformation. These are not signs or symptoms of thyroid disease.The Olweus Bullying Program developed in Norway is a well documented, effective program for reducing bullying among elementary and junior-high-school students by altering social norms and by changing school responses to bullying incidents, including efforts to protect and support victims.

The chronic anovulation and consequent hyperstimulation of the endometrium seen with polycystic ovary syndrome predispose women to endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. Conversely, multiparity and late menarche are protective of the endometrium. Combination oral contraceptive use seems to decrease the risk for endometrial cancer.

",Transient tachypnea of the newborn,Congenital heart disease,Hyaline membrane disease,Neonatal sepsis,Hyperviscosity syndrome,,2,"Cyanotic congenital heart disease can appear at the time of ductus closure. A heart murmur is not usually audible, and murmurs heard this early are usually not due to heart disease. The failure to correct hypoxemia with 100% oxygen is diagnostic for abnormal mixing of blood from the right and left circulations.Transient tachypnea presents earlier, and the hypoxia corrects with supplemental oxygen. Hyaline membrane disease can occur at 36 weeks, but would cause problems in the first hours of life. It can make oxygenation difficult, but would cause extreme distress with CO2 retention in such cases. This patient has the energy to hyperventilate and has slight respiratory alkalosis as a result.Neonatal sepsis can cause V/Q mismatching and hypoxia, and can have a delayed presentation. Concern would be high enough in this case that the patient would probably receive broad-spectrum antibiotics while awaiting culture results. On the other hand, the clinician would not want to be distracted from the evidence for congenital heart disease.The baby is polycythemic from poor intake in the first 2 days of life. The hyperviscosity syndrome can occur when the hematocrit is over 65%. It can cause poor feeding, tachypnea, and sluggishness, but does not cause hypoxia.",,

The hallmark of the disease is the rash which begins as pink maculopapules, progresses to petechiae or purpura, which are clinically palpable, and changes in color from red to dusty brown before fading. Arthritis, usually involving the knees and ankles, is present in two-thirds of cases, and gastrointestinal tract involvement results in heme-positive stools in 50% of cases. Laboratory findings are not specific or diagnostic, and include indications of mild to moderate thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, and anemia, and an elevated erthrocyte sedimentation rate.

Concentrations correlate with end-diastolic pressure, which in turn correlates with dyspnea and congestive heart failure. BNP levels can be useful when trying to determine whether dyspnea is due to cardiac, pulmonary, or deconditioning etiologies. A value of less than 100 pg/mL excludes congestive heart failure as the cause for dyspnea. If it is greater than 400 pg/mL, the likelihood of congestive heart failure is 95%. Patients with values of  100 &ndash; 400 pg/mL need further investigation.There are some pulmonary problems that may elevate BNP, such as lung cancer, cor pulmonale, and pulmonary embolus. However, these patients do not have the same extent of elevation that those with acute left ventricular dysfunction will have. If these problems can be ruled out, then individuals with levels between 100 &ndash; 400 pg/mL most likely have congestive heart failure. Initial therapy should be a loop diuretic.

Examination of the ears reveals normal tympanic membranes and a neurologic examination is negative. When a tuning fork is placed in the center of his forehead, he says the sound is much louder on the right side (Weber test).

",No treatment or further diagnostic studies are indicated,A hearing aid plus better hearing protection is all that is needed,Carotid ultrasonography should be ordered,A tympanogram is indicated,Audiometry is the best initial screening test,,5,"Acoustic neuroma symptoms are due to cranial nerve involvement and progression of tumor size. Hearing loss is present 95% of the time and tinnitus is very common. The loss is usually chronic (over 3 years), and as many as one-third of patients are unaware it has occurred. Vestibular nerve involvement most often causes mild unsteadiness and rarely has accompanying true vertigo. Trigeminal involvement can cause pain, paresthesias, or numbness of the face. Facial paralysis occurs 6% of the time. The diagnosis of acoustic neuroma is based on asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss or another cranial nerve deficit, with confirmation based on MRI with gadolinium contrast or a CT scan. The best initial screening laboratory test is audiometry, as only 5% of patients with acoustic neuroma will have a normal test. Sensorineural loss is usually in the higher frequencies. Brainstem-evoked response audiometry may be used as a further screening measure when there are unexplained symmetrics and standard audiometric testing. ",,

Their lives are often chaotic.Treatment strategies include maintaining a caring but somewhat detached professional stance. A close personal relationships is typically not therapeutic for these patients. Angry outbursts will often have to be tolerated, but limit-setting is necessary with respect to appropriate behaviors. SSRIs, atypical antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers may be of help at times, but anxiolytics are often abused and may be associated with self-mutilating behaviors.

If a woman is exposed to Rh D antigen-positive red blood cells, she can have an immune response of variable strength. This may occur in the setting of pregnancy (transplacental fetomaternal transfusion), or exposure outside of pregnancy (e.g., transfusion with mismatched blood).If a maternal antibody screen for D antigen is positive, this indicates that the current fetus MAY be at risk for hemolytic disease. The level of risk is detemined by the antibody titer. For example, an antibody titer of 1:4 poses much less risk to the fetus than a titer of 1:64.Determination of the blood type of the father is helpful if paternity is certain. If the father is homozygous Rh negative, there is no risk of alloimmunization to the fetus and the fetus is NOT at risk for hemolytic disease. In this scenario, maternal sensitization occurred either from a prior pregnancy with a different partner or from another source (e.g. transfusion). If the father is heterozygous Rh positive, then the fetus IS at risk. If paternity is uncertain, a polymerase chain reaction can be performed on 2 mL of amniotic fluid or 5 mL of chorionic villi to accurately determine the fetal Rh status. ",,

",Obtain a radiograph and give prophylactic antibiotics,Obtain a radiograph only,Give prophylactic antibiotics only,Probe the abrasions,,,1,"This presentation is consistent with a common injury called a fight bite. Radiographs are needed to determine if there is a distal metacarpal fracture so that it can be treated appropriately.

She sees doctors frequently and her past medical history is remarkable only for a right wrist fracture 2 years earlier. Her past medical records disclose that she has been admitted to the hospital twice with alcohol intoxication. Her daughter, who does not live with her, states that her mother has quit drinking about a year ago. On the third hospital day, her temperature spikes to 38.8C (101.8F), her pulse rises to 120 beats/min, her blood pressure to 190/110 mm Hg, and her respirations to 24/min. She is sweating profusely. She becomes progressively more confused, disconnects her PCA pump, and begins to swing her good arm at the bats flying in the room. She actively resists the laboratory technician attempting to draw blood and uses a number of profanities. With the help of several nurses and aides, she is briefly restrained.

Studies have found that up to 15% of patients admitted to hospital are at risk for alcohol withdrawal. Clearly the patient requires treatment and is not competent to refuse consent. Parenteral benzodiazepines are the drugs of choice for treatment of delirium tremens (DT). Not only do they have a high margin of safety, but also prospective randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that benzodiazepines are very effective in treating the symptoms and signs of alcohol withdrawal and in decreasing the incidence of seizures and DTs. The longer-acting benzodiazepines, such as chlordiazepoxide and diazepam, appear to be more effective at preventing the serious complications of seizures and DTs than shorter-acting benzodiazepines such as alprazolam and oxazepam. Most experts recommend that intermittent IV bolus dosing of diazepam or lorazepam is the treatment of choice for drug therapy of DTs.If the intravenous route is not available, then intramuscular lorazepam (or midazolam as an alternative) is recommended. Diazepam and chlordiazepoxide should not be administered intramuscularly because absorption is erratic.Also, if 65 years old or severe liver disease, severe asthma or respiratory failure are present, use short acting benzodiazepines - lorazepam PO/SL/IMNeuroleptics have been shown to be inferior to sedative-hypnotics in reducing mortality and duration of alcohol withdrawal delirium. Drugs such as haloperidol (Haldol) should not be used, as they lower seizure threshold and can prolong QTc, while doing nothing to address the underlying pathophysiology.Barbiturates such as phenobarbital and pentobarbital are also useful to treat delirium tremens. However, compared with benzodiazepines, they have a lower therapeutic index and can cause respiratory depression and hypotension. Barbiturates should be reserved for patients refractory to or unable to take benzodiazepines. ",,

The measurement of serum CA-125 is a convenient, inexpensive test which has been shown to detect ovarian cancer at an earlier stage. However, there has been no conclusive evidence that finding ovarian cancer at an earlier stage using this test will result in an improved chance of a woman surviving this condition. Furthermore, since the incidence of ovarian cancer is low, 99% of average-risk women with high values of CA-125 will not have ovarian cancer.

Ultrasonography, unfortunately, does not provide a particularly accurate estimate of fetal weight for large fetuses. The risk of difficult vaginal delivery and shoulder dystocia does increase with birth weight above 4000 &ndash; 4500 g. This has led to attempts to prevent shoulder dystocia and possible birth injury by either performing an elective cesarean section or inducing labor when the fetus is estimated to be macrosomic. However, no studies have shown a benefit to either intervention in otherwise uncomplicated pregnancies. Suspected macrosomnia on its own is not longer considered an indication for induction or cesarean section.

Plantar fasciitis classically presents as morning pain. Tarsal tunnel syndrome causes neuropathic pain in the distribution of the posterior tibial nerve, radiating into the plantar aspect of the foot toward the toes.Lumbar radiculopathy involves pain radiating down the leg into the heel, and is usually associated with weakness of dorsiflexion of the big toe and a decreased ankle reflex.

2723,2,OBGYN,A 28-year-old white female at 28 weeks gestation with an uncomplicated pregnancy presents with pain in the right wrist. She thinks it may be related to hand-washing several articles of clothing in a creek and hanging them on a line to dry while on a camping trip. The pain in the wrist radiates down the thumb and the radial side of the wrist. There is no history of trauma or penetrating injury. On examination there is tenderness when the right radial styloid is compressed. The pain is exacerbated by ulnar rotation of the wrist while the patient's fingers are folded over the thumb.The most likely diagnosis is ,Osteoarthritis of the first carpometacarpal joint,Occult navicular fracture,Radial sensory nerve entrapment,Carpal tunnel syndrome,De Quervain's tenosynovitis,,5,"De Quervain's tenosynovitis is a cumulative movement disorder due to chronic overuse of the wrist and hand, involving the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis tendons, which share a common tendon sheath. Repeated forceful gripping, grasping, and wringing movements lead to thickening of the tendon sheath and subsequent inflammation and stenosis of the sheath as it passes over the distal radius. This can progress to fibrosis and loss of flexibility in the thumb in flexion. The condition is more common in pregnancy, after trauma, and with rheumatoid arthritis.The diagnosis is made by physical examination. There is tenderness over the radial styloid, and resisting thumb extension and abduction will elicit pain. Finkelstein's test, folding the fingers over the thumb and gently passively deviating the thumb in an ulnar direction, will often cause such pain that the patient will lift the shoulder to prevent the examiner from stretching the tendon.Other diagnostic considerations include osteoarthritis of the first carpometacarpal joint, which may also cause pain over the radial styloid, and a positive Finkelstein's test. If injecting the site with local anesthetic gives relief, an arthritic etiology can be excluded. Navicular (scaphoid) fracture is caused by a fall or a direct blow to the wrist. The symptoms are pain on the thumb side of the wrist, swelling in that area, and difficulty gripping objects. Individuals with radial sensory nerve entrapment will have paresthesias over the dorsum of the hand and a positive Tinel's sign over the nerve in the mid-forearm, just distal to the belly of the brachioradialis muscle. Hyperpronation of the forearm reproduces these symptoms. Carpal tunnel syndrome involves entrapment of the median nerve, causing pain in the thumb, index finger, long finger, and radial half of the ring finger. ",,
2724,4,Pediatrics,"The mother of a 3-year-old male is concerned that he doesn't like being help, doesn't interact much with other children, and rarely smiles. Of the following, which feature would be most helpful in distinguishing Asperger's syndrome from autism in this patient? ",Normal language development,Delayed gross motor development,Repetitive fine motor mannerisms,Preoccupation with parts of objects,Focused patterns of intense interest,,1,"The DSM-IV categorizes Asperger's syndrome and autism as pervasive developmental disorders. In both conditions, children have significant difficulties with social interactions, although the impairment is more severe and sustained in autism. Both Asperger's and autism may be associated with symptoms of repetitive motor mannerisms, restricted patterns of interest (which are abnormal in focus or intensity), or preoccupation with parts of objects.However, unlike children with Asperger's syndrome, autistic children have serious problems with communication skills, either in the development of speech itself or in the ability to carry on a conversation. Normal, age-appropriate language skills in a 3-year-old would rule out a diagnosis of autism.It is an important distinction to make, as the prognosis for independent functioning in children with Asperger's syndrome is significantly better than in children with autism.

Upon reviewing her history, you find that she is on 18 different medications. While attempting to obtain additional history and medical information, you decide to stop or decrease some of her medications and monitor her response.Which one of the following would be most appropriate to stop or decrease initially? ","Sertraline (Zoloft), 25 mg daily","Acetaminophen/diphenhydramine (Tylenol PM HS), 500 mg/25 mg dailyB)","Dipyridamole/aspirin (Aggrenox), 200 mg/25 mg","Digoxin, 0.125 mg every other day","Fexofenadine, 180 mg bid",,2,"Polypharmacy is a term commonly associated with physicians' prescribing tendencies for the elderly population. Although the term carries a negative connotation, the use of numerous medications is necessary in some elderly patients. However, some medications have been identified as having a considerably higher potential to cause problems when prescribed to elderly patients.The older antihistamines, primarily diphenhydramine, cause many adverse CNS effects such as cognitive slowing and delirium in older patients. This effect is more pronounced in elderly patients with some degree of preexisting cognitive impairment. The anticholinergic properties of older antihistamines produce effects such as dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, and drowsiness. Thus, the use of antihistamines as sleeping agents or for symptomatic relief often leads to problems in elderly patients. The sedative effect of older antihistamines also increases older patients' risks of falls. Hip fracture and subsequent death have been reported in patients who use older antihistamines such as diphenhydramine. Thus, the acetaminophen/diphenhydramine would be an appropriate medication to stop initially.&gt;Sertraline is an SSRI, a preferred class for the treatment of depression in the elderly as compared to the tricyclic antidepressants, which are associated with several side effects. &gt;When used in elderly patients with congestive heart failure, digoxin should be given in a dosage no greater than 0.125 mg daily; the low dose used in this individual is not inappropriate until the reason for its use is clarified. &gt;Fexofenadine is one of the newer nonsedating antihistamines that is recommended for treating allergy symptoms in the elderly. For seasonal allergies the recommended dose for adults and children 12 years or older is 60 mg twice daily or 180 mg once daily. &gt; Short-acting dipyridamole may cause orthostatic hypotension. Do not consider the long-acting dipyridamole (which has better properties than the short-acting in older adults) except with patients with artificial heart valves.

It is generally well-tolerated at the once-weekly preventive dose, but due to potential neuropsychiatric side effects seen even at the weekly dose, it is not recommended in epileptic patients.Although mefloquine is not specifically approved in pregnancy, available data has shown no adverse outcomes. Given the risks of resistant Plasmodium falciparum infection and the fact that doxycycline is contraindicated in pregnancy, mefloquine should be considered. Mefloquine should not be used in patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities, but concurrent use with beta-blockers in the absence of conduction abnormalities is safe.

Jaw claudication and depression may be associated findings, and paralysis and stroke develop less frequently. Intracranial arteries are usually spared, but the verterbral basilar arteries may be involved. Sudden death with arteritis of the coronary arteries is extremely rare. Seizures are not characteristic.

The absolute risk reduction (AAR) is the difference between the incidence of disease in the treatment group and the incidence in the control group. In this example the ARR is 5% minus 3%= 2%. The number needed to treat (NNT) equals the reciprocal of the ARR: 1/.02 = 50.The RRR is not a very useful clinical statistic in clinical practice. It amplifies small differences and makes clinically insignificant findings appear significant because it essentially ignores the baseline risk &ldquo;How much will I decrease my patient's risk of an adverse outcomes by this treatment?&rdquo;.

Studies show that patients who present for treatment of herpes zoster within 72 hours will benefit from antiviral therapy such as famciclovir to reduce the pain and decrease the risk of postherpetic neuralgia. Treating zoster pain with tricyclic antidepressants in low dosage (10 - 25 mg amitriptyline) may also decrease risk. While steroids added to antiviral therapy may be of benefit in short-term therapy, they do not reduce pain at 6 months. ",,
2746,4,Pediatrics,"A 3 year old female presents with urinary frequency, dysuria, and fever to 39.0C (102.2F). She denies nausea, vomiting, and flank pain. There is no prior history of urinary infection and no family history of urinary tract abnormalities. Urethral catheterization reveals bacteriuria and a urine culture reveals 100,000 colony-forming units of Escherichia coli. She is started on appropriate antibiotic therapy. She returns after 4 days with no improvement of her symptoms. Evaluation to rule out anatomic abnormalities should include: ",Renal ultrasonography only if she has recurrent infections,Renal ultrasonography and voiding cysourethrography (VCUG) only if she has recurrent infections,Renal ultrasonography and cystoscopy only if she has recurrent infections,Renal ultrasonography for this primary episode of infection,Renal ultrasonography and VCUG for this primary episode of infection,,5,"In the first few months of life, the incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in boys is higher than that of girls. However, after that time period, UTIs are much more common in females, with the peak incidence in the 2- to 3-year range. The clinical presentation of UTI in children is similar to that of adults, including dysuria, hematuria, frequency, incontinence, suprapubic tenderness, and low-grade fever. Upper tract infection is suggested by high fever, nausea, vomiting, flank pain, and lethargy.All children who have a culture-documented UTI should undergo evaluation of the anatomy of the urinary tract. This is due to the fact that children who are at most risk for renal parenchymal damage are those with an anatomic defect. In general, studies to evaluate both the upper and lower tract are recommended.Children under the age of 5 years with a UTI, any child with a UTI and a fever, school-aged girls who have had two or more UTIs, and any boy with a UTI should have a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) to evaluate for vesiculoureteral reflux and renal ultrasonography to evaluate the kidneys. Cystoscopy and retrograde pyelography are rarely indicated in the workup.",,
2747,2,OBGYN,A 21-year-old married Hispanic female who is using no method of contraception presents to your office for evaluation of vaginal spotting 6 weeks after her last menstrual period. Her periods have previously been regular. She has had one previous episode of pelvic inflammatory disease. A home pregnancy test is positive. Which one of the following is true in this situation? ,Serum hCG levels should double every 2  3 days if the pregnancy is viable,Painless bleeding excludes the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy,Laparoscopy should be performed to exclude ectopic pregnancy,A serum progesterone level  25 ng/mL indicates that ectopic pregnancy is likely,,,1,"Early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy requires a high index of suspicion. Risk factors include previous ectopic pregnancy, tubal sterilization, pelvic inflammatory disease, IUD use, and in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol. The classic triad of missed menses, pain, and bleeding may not also be present. In early pregnancies of less than 5 weeks gestation, serial hCG levels are helpful. Serum hCG levels double every 1.4  2 days. In a healthy pregnancy the level is expected to increase by at least 66% in 48 hours. Combining serial hCG levels with transvaginal ultrasonography is the best combination for evaluation of first-trimester problems.Serum hCG levels correlate well with sonographic landmarks. At 5 weeks gestation in a normal pregnancy, serum hCG is  1000 mIU/mL and a gestational  sac can be visualized in the uterus. Serum hCG is  2500 mIU/mL at 6 weeks and a yolk sac can be seen within the gestational sac. An hCG level of 5000 mIU/mL is compatible with visualization of a fetal pole. When the level is 17,000 mIU/mL, cardiac activity is detectable.Progesterone levels are also predictive of fetal outcome. A single level of 25 ng/mL or higher indicates a healthy pregnancy and excludes ectopic pregnancy with a sensitivity of 98%. If the level is  5 ng/mL, the pregnancy is nonviable. Assessment of fetal well-being is difficult if levels are in the intermediate range of 5  25 ng/mL.",,

Now they occur every 20 days and last for 10 days, and are heavier than they were previously. A physical examination reveals no obvious anatomic source of bleeding, and a Papanicolaou (Pap) test is normal. A pregnancy test is negative and a blood workup for organic causes of irregular menses is also negative. She takes no medications.Which one of the following would be most appropriate at this point? ",Pelvic ultrasonography,Increasing the dosage of the oral contraceptive,Changing to a progesterone-only contraceptive,Reassurance that the problem will resolve on its own,,,1,"Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is common, but the diagnosis is made by excluding other pathologies. Changes in bleeding pattern may be due to cervical pathology which will usually be seen on a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear; anatomic problems such as polyps which can be detected on examination; organic causes such as thyroid problems; prolactinemia, coagulopathy, hepatic dysfunction, or adrenal dysfunction, which can be detected by laboratory testing; and pregnancy. If these conditions are ruled out, endometrial evaluation is important to exclude cancer, especially when any risk factors are present. Risk factors include age over 35, a history of anovulatory cycles, obesity, nulliparity, a history of tamoxifen use, and diabetes mellitus. In this patient an endometrial biopsy is not mandatory given her age and lack of other risk factors. Ultrasonography is recommended to evaluate the thickness at the endometrial lining and to look for other uterine causes of bleeding such as polyps or fibroids.",,

",Beta2-Agonists,Inhaled corticosteroids,Oxygen supplementation,Pulsed antibiotic therapy,,,3,"For patients afflicted with severe COPD, as evidenced by an FEV1 of 1.0 or less and PaO2 of 60 mm Hg or less, only supplemental oxygen has been shown to positively affect survival, reduce dyspnea scores, and reduce pulmonary artery pressure. Beta-Agonists and inhaled corticosteroids, especially when used in combination, are associated with a lower rate of exacerbations, but have no direct effect on mortality. Smoking cessation, while clearly of benefit to all, is the only therapy to slow the decline in lung function but does not affect survival. Finally, there is no compelling study showing any impact on survival with pulsed antibiotic therapy. ",,

His past history is significant for a pulmonary embolus after a cholecystectomy 15 years ago. His examination is unremarkable except that he is 23 kg (50 lb) overweight.The most appropriate recommendation to the urologist would be to ,Cancel the surgery indefinitely,Place the patient on 650 mg of aspiring daily prior to surgery,"Start the patient on subcutaneous enoxaparin (Lovenox), 40 mg 1  2 hr prior to surgery and once a day after surgery",Start warfarin (Coumadin) after surgery with a goal INR of 1.5,Start intravenous heparin according to a weight-based protocol 24 hours after surgery,,3,A patient with history of postoperative venous thromboembolism is at risk for similar events with subsequent major operations. The most appropriate treatment of the choices listed would be subcutaneous enoxaparain. Aspirin is ineffective for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism. Warfarin is effective at an INR of 2.0  3.0. Full anticoagulation with heparin is unnecessary for prophylaxis and can result in a higher rate of postoperative hemorrhage. ,,

",Neither biologic nor psychological factors play a part in this condition,This condition is a variation of a depressive disorder,Oral contraceptive pills are consistently effective in the treatment of this condition,This problem can be effectively treated with serotonergic antidepressants,Alprazolam (Xanax) is an effective first-line agent for treatment of this condition,,4,"Women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) experience a cluster of mood, cognitive, and physical symptoms that recur in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and remit in the follicular phase. Multiple rigorously conducted, placebo-controlled, randomized trials have consistently shown the value of SSRIs, especially if administered during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Among women whose mothers have been affected by PMS, 70% have PMS themselves, compared with 37% of women whose mothers have not been affected. Because many patients with PMDD do not have depressive symptoms, this disorder should not be considered as simply a depressive variant. Some studies have shown that symptoms actually worsen with administration of oral contraceptive pills. Because of the potential for drug dependence, high-potency benzodiazepines such as alprazolam should be used only as second-line drug therapy if an optimal response is not achieved with an SSRI. ",,

Of the following, the best treatment is: ",Topical corticosteroids,Oral corticosteroids,Topical acyclovir (Zovirax),Oral valacyclovir (Valtrex),Topical capsaicin (Zostrix),,4,"The rash described is typical of herpes zoster. This commonly occurs in older individuals who have had chickenpox in childhood. The treatment of choice for acute herpes zoster is oral antiviral agents. Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famiciclovir have all been shown to be efficacious with 7 days of oral treatment. Studies suggest that valacyclovir may be superior to acyclovir in decreasing both acute and postherpetic pain. Famciclovir appears to be equal in efficacy to valacyclovir. Topical acyclovir may be effective for more limited forms of herpes simplex, but is usually not effective for herpes zoster. Topical and oral corticosteroids may have some use for combating the inflammatory process, and may decrease the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia in certain individuals. Topic capsaicin may be useful in treating the pain of acute herpes zoster infection, as well as postherpetic neuralgia. ",,

Also, the severity of delirium tends to fluctuate over the course of hours, with patients appearing quite normal at time and wildly agitated with hallucinations at others. Frequently, extreme changes in psychomotor activity are noted with delirium; although this may also be seen with dementia, it is typically not seen until the latter stages. Bipolar disorders are characterized by the occurrence of mania, which is manifested by a full-blown disturbance of mood together with elation and irritability. Its onset is generally in the third or fourth decade of life.

Studies of clinically referred adults with ADHD show that about half have clinically important levels of hyperactivity and impulsivity and up to 90% have prominent attentional symptoms. Like some youth with ADHD, adults with ADHD tend to have additional cognitive deficits, specifically executive function deficits, which include problems encoding and manipulating information and difficulties with organization and time management.Research shows that using retrospective self-reports of adults is a valid method of diagnosing ADHD. Studies have shown that the consistent reporting of childhood ADHD symptoms by both adults and their parents is highly correlated. Research has also found strong agreement between the self-reports of adults and their partners regarding ADHD symptoms.",,
2778,4,Pediatrics,"In early February, you receive a call from your office nurse. Her 5-month-old daughter has been ill for several days. What started as a mild upper respiratory infection has progressed and she now has profuse rhinorrhea, a temperature of 100.2 F (37.9 C), and audible wheezing. In spite of an almost nonstop cough, she does not appear acutely ill.The organism responsible for this child's illness is most likely to be: ",Group B Streptococcus,Mycoplasma pneumoniae,Bordetella pertussis,Parainfluenza virus 3,Respiratory syncytial virus,,5,The most common cause of pneumonia in children age 4 months to 4 years is respiratory syncytial virus. Other viruses may cause pneumonia as well. The peak incidence of respiratory syncytial virus is between 2 and 7 months of age. Wheezing and profuse rhinorrhea are characteristic and the disease typically occurs in mid-winter or early spring epidemics. Parainfluenza 3 typically affects older infants and is not common in winter. Mycoplasma tends to affect older children and children with bacterial illnesses; those infected with this organism generally appear more acutely ill.,,
2779,1,Medicine,"A 47 year old male presents with a history of fatigue, arthralgias, nonspecific abdominal pain, and erectile dysfunction. The initial laboratory workup reveals a normal CBC and basic metabolic profile, but slightly elevated transaminases.Which one of the following is the most appropriate initial test to evaluate for hereditary hemochromatosis? ",Serum ferritin testing,Serum transferrin saturation,Serum ceruloplasmin testing,Serum alpha-fetoprotein testing,HFE gene testing,,2,"Hereditary hemochromatosis is the most common single-gene disorder in Caucasians. Approximately 1 in 250-300 Caucasians are homozygous for the mutation and 1 in 10 is a carrier. The classic description for this disorder has been the triad of cutaneous hyperpigmentation, diabetes mellitus, and cirrhosis; however, this represents very late manifestations. If treatment is initiated early, life expectancy is normal and many of the irreversible manifestations of the disease can be avoided. Unfortunately, while it is estimated that the average primary care physician sees one patient every 2 weeks with the disorder, most will actually diagnose only a few cases in their careers.The disease results from increased intestinal iron absorption with subsequent deposition of iron in organs such as the heart, liver, skin, pituitary gland, and genitalia. The differential diagnosis should include iron overload from other sources such as chronic anemia, prolonged iron supplementation, multiple transfusions, and chronic liver disease. Alcohol use and hepatitis C may accelerate the expression of the disease. Early symptomatology commonly includes arthralgias, fatigue, and impotence, but approximately 75% of patients are asymptomatic early on. The serum transferrin saturation is the best initial screening test. It is calculated by dividing the serum iron concentration by the total iron-binding capacity and multiplying by 100. The normal range is 14%-50% with the range for hereditary hemochromatosis being 51%-100%. However, it may be normal early in the course of the disease and can be elevated in other states such as alcoholic liver disease and viral hepatitis.While serum ferritin is a sensitive assessment of iron overload, it is an acute phase reactant and is often elevated in inflammatory and infectious conditions. It is not the recommended screening test for hereditary hemochromatosis. Serum ceruloplasmin is elevated in neoplastic disorders, inflammatory states, systemic lupus erythematosus, primary biliary cirrhosis and rheumatoid arthritis, and low in Wilson's disease, advanced liver disease, total parenteral nutrition, malabsorption, and nephritic syndrome. It is not useful in the evaluation of hemochromatosis. Serum alpha-fetoprotein is useful in screening for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis, but is not a screening test for hemochromatosis. Genetic testing for this disorder is available and the gene, HFE, is located on the short arm of chromosome 6. However, this would not be appropriate as an initial screening test. ",,
2780,4,Pediatrics,"A 4-week-old full-term male is brought to your office by his parents. They report that their child started vomiting just after his 1-week visit. The parents are concerned because they think the vomiting is worsening, occurring after every feeding, and shooting across the room. You note that the baby is afebrile, but has not gained any weight since birth.Based on this information, the most likely diagnosis is: ",Formula intolerance,Meningitis,Viral gastroenteritis,Pyloric stenosis,Inappropriate feeding,,4,"Pyloric stenosis fits the described scenario; it is characterized by the early onset of worsening projectile vomiting and poor weight gain, and occurs most often in full-term male infants who are otherwise healthy. Formula intolerance causes regurgitation, as would inappropriate feeding. Meningitis, whether viral or bacterial, would be associated with fever. Viral gastroenteritis is a common cause of vomiting in older children, and is usually associated with fever and diarrhea. ",,
2781,1,Medicine,A positive spot urine test for homovanillic acid (HVA) and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) is a marker for which one of the following? ,Hepatoblastoma,Wilms' tumor,Lymphoma,Malignant teratoma,Neuroblastoma,,5,"Tumor markers are useful in determining the diagnosis and sometimes the prognosis of certain tumors. They can aid in assessing response to therapy and detecting tumor recurrence. Serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) testing, as well as spot urine testing for homovanillic acid (HVA) and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), should be obtained if neuroblastoma or pheochromocytoma is suspected; both should be collected before surgical intervention. Quantitative beta-human chorlonic gonadotropin (hCG) levels can be elevated in liver tumors and germ cells tumors. alpha-Fetoprotein is excreted by many malignant teratomas and by liver and germ cell tumors.

2782,2,OBGYN,A 32-year-old gravida 3 para 2 is in labor at term following an uncomplicated prenantal course. As you deliver the fetal head it retracts against the perineum. Downward traction fails to free the anterior shoulder.The most appropriate course of action would be to ,Apply increasingly strong downward traction to the fetal head,Have an assistant apply fundal pressure,Deliberately fracture the clavicle of the fetus,Begin an intravenous nitroglycerin drip,Place the mother's thighs on her abdomen,,5,"While there are several risk factors for shoulder dystocia, most cases occur in fetuses of normal birth weight and are not anticipated. Once it does occur, excessive force should not be applied to the fetal head or neck and fundal pressure should be avoided, as these maneuvers are unlikely to free the fetus and can injure both mother and infant.Up to 40% of shoulder dysotica cases can be successfully treated with the McRoberts maneuver, in which the maternal hips are flexed and abducted, placing the thighs up on the abdomen. Adding suprapubic pressure can resolve about half of all shoulder dysoticas. Additional maneuvers include internal rotation, removal of the posterior arm, and rolling the patient over into the all-fours position. As a last resort, one can deliberately fracture the fetal clavicle, perform a cesarean section with the vertex being pushed back into the birth canal, or have the surgeon rotate the infant transabdominally with vaginal extraction performed by another physician. General anesthesia or nitroglycerin, orally or intravenously, may be used to achieve musculoskeletal or uterine relaxation. Intentional division of the cartilage of the sympysis under local anesthesia has been used in developing countries, but should be used only if all other maneuvers have failed and a cesarean delivery is not feasible.

Adnexal torsion is a surgical emergency.Pelvic ultrasonography, preferably with a vaginal probe, can be beneficial in the workup of ruptured ovarian cyst, pelvic abscess, and pelvic inflammatory disease without abscess. The Doppler flow study is not required with these conditions. ",,
2784,1,Medicine,"An 84-year-old black female is brought to your office by her daughter, who is concerned that the mother has memory problems and is neglecting to pay her monthly bills. The mother also is forgetting appointments and asks the same questions repeatedly. This problem has been steadily worsening over the last 1-2 years.The patient has very little insight into her problems, scores 24 out of a possible 30 points on the Mini-Mental State Examination, and has difficulty with short-term recall and visuospatial tasks. Her physical examination and a thorough laboratory workup are normal. A CT scan of the brain reveals diffuse atrophy.Which one of the following is the most likely etiology for the patient's memory problem? ",Alzheimer's disease,Dementia resulting from depression,Lewy body dementia,Multi-infarct dementia,Normal aging,,1,"The patient shows classic symptoms of early Alzheimer's disease, with difficulties in at least two cognitive domains that are severe enough to influence daily living. Normal aging changes can decrease one's ability to retrieve information but do not influence daily living and are usually noticed more by the patient than by family members. Depression was previously thought to cause &ldquo;pseudodementia&rdquo; with significant regularity. However, several recent studies have shown that treating depressive symptoms does not result in significantly improved cognitive performance. It is now believed that progressive memory loss frequently results in depressive symptoms, rather than the converse. Lewy body dementia is associated with physical findings of parkinsonism and often the presence of visual hallucinations, both of which are absent in this patient. There are no signs of multiple infarcts on brain imaging, effectively ruling out this diagnosis. ",,

The parents report that the seizure lasted 5 minutes, with confusion for the next 15 minutes. This is the child's first seizure. There is no family history of seizures. His medical history is normal except for a 1-day history of a URI.While initially lethargic in the emergency department, the child is now awake and playful, with a temperature of 39.5 C (103.2 F) and a normal examination. Appropriate diagnostic tests are performed, including a blood glucose level, which is 96 mg/dL.Which one of the following would be most appropriate to administer at this point?

Treatment includes finding a source for the fever; this should include a lumbar puncture if meningitis is suspected. The most common infections associated with febrile seizures include viral upper respiratory infections, otitis media, and roseola. Antipyretics are the first-line treatment. Antibiotics are indicated only for appropriate treatment of underlying infections. Phenytoin and carbamazepine are ineffective for febrile seizures.Phenobarbital is sometimes used for prevention of recurrent febrile seizures, but is not indicated as an initial therapy. Only 30%-50% of children with an initial febrile seizure will have recurrent seizures. ",,
2786,3,PMCH,"A 72-year-old female has stable but moderately severe COPD requiring 2 L of continuous oxygen. She plans to attend the college graduation of her first grandchild, and wants to fly to avoid a 12-hour car ride. Her PaO2 on room air is 55 mm Hg.According to the Federal Air Regulations, she MUST ",Bring her own oxygen from home,Bring a medical certificate from you certifying that she is cleared to fly without oxygen,Arrange through the airline for oxygen to be available on board and in the airports,Find a form of transportation other than air travel,"Undergo preflight testing, including pulmonary function testing and high-altitude simulation testing, before she can be cleared to fly",,3,"According to Federal Air Regulations, passengers who require oxygen for stable medical conditions cannot bring their own supplies and equipment and must arrange through the airline, 24-48 hours in advance, for oxygen to be made available on board, at layovers, and at final destinations. Anyone with a preflight sea level PaO2 below 68-70 mm Hg is advised NOT to fly unless supplemental oxygen can be arranged. This is because commercial aircraft maintain a relative cabin altitude between 5000 and 8000 feet during routine flight. This altitude corresponds to a decreased barometric pressure, which causes a corresponding drop in the normal baseline PaO2. In normal healthy individuals, this corresponds to a drop from a PaO2 of 98 mm Hg to a PaO2 of 60-70 mm Hg. On the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, a PaO2 of 60 mm Hg is the point at which there is a steep gradient of the pressure/saturation relationship. This patient has a baseline PaO2 of only 55 mm Hg, so she certainly could not sustain a flight without oxygen.While it may be prudent to have a given patient complete some respiratory testing prior to flying, no specific preflight testing is required.

2787,2,OBGYN,You have just diagnosed and treated gonorrheal cervicitis in a 24-year-old female who is in her second trimester of pregnancy. The patient has a friend who had a stillborn infant and she is concerned that the gonorrhea may predispose her to stillbirth.Which one of the following would be most appropriate in this situation? ,"Inform the patient that stillbirth related to gonorrhea is very rare, and that special fetal and maternal monitoring is not needed","Perform fetal monitoring and serial vaginal cultures, starting at 32 weeks gestation","Perform monthly vaginal cultures for gonorrhea, starting at 24 weeks gestation",Administer prophylactic ciprofloxacin (Cipro) weekly until delivery,,,1,"Gonorrhea is a rare cause of stillbirth, probably because it is unusual for the gonorrhea organism to ascend into the uterus. The organism lacks affinity for fetal membranes. Since gonorrhea is easily and effectively treated with ceftriaxone or cefixime, follow-up cultures and monitoring are not needed unless symptoms persist. Quinolones (including ciprofloxacin) and tetracycline, which are indicated in nonpregnant patients, are contraindicated in pregnancy.",,
2788,5,Psychiatry,Which one of the following criteria is most likely to signify that an individual has bulimia nervosa rather than anorexia nervosa?,The absence of at least three consecutive menstrual cycles in a postmenarchal nonpregnant female,Recurrent episodes of binge eating,Refusal to maintain a body weight greater than normal for age and height,"Intense fear of weight gain or becoming fat, even though underweight",Denial of the seriousness of the current low body weight,,2,"The key clinical finding in bulimia nervosa is not, as is often assumed, vomiting. Binge eating is the sine qua non for bulimia. Temporary relief of the associated depressed mood and self-deprecating thoughts is achieved by methods intended to rid the body of the effects of calories. More than 80% of patients with bulimia nervosa engage in self-induced vomiting or laxative or diuretic abuse for this purpose.

Universal screening is recommended for women over the age of 65, as well as for women age 60-64 with risk factors for osteopororsis. Multiple risk assessment scales have been studied to identify women over the age of 65 who are at increased risk for hip fracture. None of the scales, however, had good discriminatory performance. Thus, the criteria for screening women less than 65 years of age are unclear. ",,

The change in the shape of the uterus from discoid to globular, along with a rise in fundal height, an apparent lengthening of the umbilical cord, and a gush of vaginal bleeding are signs of spontaneous separation that occurs in the third stage of labor. It is not uncommon for the first stage of labor to last around 18-20 hours in nulliparas and 14-16 hours in multiparas.The second stage of labor (the period between the complete dilation of the cervix to the delivery of the baby) usually lasts about 50 minutes in nulliparas and 20 minutes in multiparas. This stage of labor can be prolonged somewhat by the use of regional anesthesia. An episiotomy is an incision of the perineum used to facilitate vaginal delivery; it is useful for patients in whom the perineum does not readily stretch and/or when delivery must be expedited. It is part of the management of the second stage of labor. After the cervix becomes completely dilated (by definition, the second stage of labor), patients usually experience an urge to push with contractions. Regional anesthesia may partially or completely blunt this urge.",,

Which one of the following is true regarding infection with this virus?  ,Most deaths are due to hemorrhagic complications,"In confirmed cases, antiviral medications are effective",Transmission occurs through infected bird droppings,The most severely affected patients have serious neurologic involvement,Infected patients typically develop migratory arthritis,,4," West Nile virus (WNV) is transmitted to humans by the bite of mosquitoes infected after biting virus-carrying birds. Originally discovered in West Africa, it was first seen in the North America in New York City in 1999. It is currently widespread throughout the continental U.S. Although the virus is a human neuropathogen, most infected persons have no symptoms. One out of 150 human infections results in severe neurologic disease with encephalitis, meningitis, flaccid paralysis, or coma. The elderly are at greatest risk for severe disease.Most symptomatic patients have a self-limited febrile illness with chills, headache, myalgias, and fatigue. Stiff neck, arthralgias, cough, and rash are uncommon symptoms. Hemorrhage is not associated with WNV infection and infected bird droppings are not a mode of WNV transmission.Treatment is supportive, even in severe disease. The efficacy of antiviral medicines is anecdotal and is not supported by the results of controlled clinical trials.",,

The child's palms and soles are erythematous and the periungal regions show desquamation of the skin. He has minimally painful nodes located in the anterior cervical region, about 2x2 cm in size. A Streptococcus screen is negative.The most appropriate management at this time would be: ","Intramuscular benzathine penicillin G (Bicillin L-A), 600,000 U",Intravenous nafcillin (Nallpen),Intravenous immune globulin and aspirin,"Prednisone, 2-3 mg/kg daily",A fine-needle biopsy of the lymph nodes,,3,"Kawaski disease, or mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, is a common form of vasculitis in childhood. It is typically self-limited, with fever and acute inflammation lasting 12 days on average without therapy. However, if untreated, this illness can result in heart failure, coronary artery aneurysm, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or occlusion of peripheral arteries. It is most common in those under the age of 5 years. To diagnose this disease, fever must be present for 5 days or more with no other explanation. In addition, at least four of the following symptoms must be present: 1) nonexudative conjunctivitis that spares the limbus; 2) changes in the oral membranes such as diffuse erythema, injected or fissured lips, or &ldquo;strawberry tongue&rdquo;; 3) erythema of palms and soles, and/or edema of the hands or feet followed by periungual desquamation; 4) cervical adenopathy in the anterior cervical triangle with at least one node larger than 1.5 cm in diameter; and, 5) an erythematous polymorphous rash, which may be targetoid or purpuric in 20% of cases. The disease must be diagnosed from toxic shock syndrome, streptococcal scarlet fever, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, measles, adenovirus infection, echovirus infection, and drug reactions.Treatment significantly diminishes the risk of complications. Current recommendations are to hospitalize the patient for treatment with intravenous immune globulin. In addition, aspirin is used for both its anti-inflammatory and antithrombolitic effects. While prednisone is used to treat other forms of vasculitis, it is considered unsafe in Kawaski disease, as a previous study showed an extraordinarily high rate of coronary artery aneurysm with its use.

Bowel sounds are hypoactive and epigastric tenderness without guarding is present.Which one of the following is most accurate regarding laboratory testing for possible pancreatitis in this situation? ,Elevated serum triglyceride levels can cause falsely elevated serum amylase levels,There is a direct correlation between serum amylase levels and the severity of the pancreatitis,Serum amylase and lipase levels may be falsely low in renal failure,A serum lipase level that is three times normal is highly specific for pancreatitis,A serum amylase level that is three times normal is highly specific for pancreatitis,,4,"A serum lipase level is a more specific test for pancreatitis than an amylase level. Amylase is more likely to be elevated in other acute abdominal conditions. Amylase levels may also be elevated with salivary gland abnormalities, chronic sialadenitis, renal failure, and liver disease.Although elevated triglyceride levels are associated with pancreatitis, patients with hypertriglyceridemia and proven pancreatitis have been found to have deceptively low levels of amylase, and sometimes of lipase activity. There is no significant correlation between the magnitude of serum amylase elevation and the severity of pancreatitis. In fact, a milder form of acute pancreatitis is often associated with higher levels of serum amylase than those seen in a more severe form of the disease. Serum trypsinogen is secreted specifically by the pancreas and is helpful in determining when elevated amylase levels are coming from non-pancreatic sources. Because amylase, lipase, and trypsinogen are all cleared by the kidneys, renal failure, particularly with a creatinine clearance  50 mL/min, may result in delayed clearance and false elevations of enzymes.

There is no evidence available that treatment of mild essential hypertension during pregnancy provides any benefit to the mother. Given the potential for short- and long-term risk to the fetus from antihypertensive treatment, it is advisable to discontinue antihypertensive treatment, monitor the mother for signs of preeclampsia, and monitor fetal growth and development. Medication is not necessary as long as the systolic blood pressure remains below 140 mm Hg, the diastolic blood pressure remains below 90 mm Hg, and there are no signs of preeclampsia or fetal growth restriction. Should the mother develop severe hypertension, treatment can be initiated with long-acting nifedipine, labetalol, a thiazide diuretic, or methylodopa.

There are seven different kinds of elder abuse: physical abuse, sexual abuse, psychological abuse, financial abuse, neglect, abandonment, and self-neglect. The most common form of abuse substantiated by Adult Protective Services is neglect, with sexual abuse being the least common. Another study listed physical abuse as the most prevalent, followed by verbal aggression and neglect.Women are most often the victims of elder abuse. Approximately 90% of abusers are related to the victim, with the adult children being the most likely perpetrators. As abusers, an equal number of men and women are guilty of neglect, but other forms of abuse are predominantly committed by men. If the spouse is the perpetrator, there is likely a previous history of violence in the relationship. Abusers are often alcohol or drug abusers and many times are dependent on the victim for money and housing. ",,

Breastfeeding should be well established by 4 weeks postpartum. Pumping may allow a woman to continue to provide breast milk while not physically available. Refreezing breast milk destroys valuable proteins and is not recommended. Separation of breast milk, in the refrigerator or at room temperature, is normal; the milk just needs to be shaken to re-emulsify the fat. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OHSA) states that exposure to breast milk does not constitute an occupational hazard. Breast milk should never be thawed in boiling water or in the microwave; this destroys valuable proteins. Breast milk may be stored in either glass or plastic bags or bottles. ",,

The peak incidence is in the preschool-age range of 2-5 years when adenotonsillar tissue is greatest in relation to airway size. It is associated with obesity in older children. Common clinical manifestations include snoring with sleep interruptions and respiratory pauses. Polysomnography is not the gold standard for the diagnosis. Although the child has inattention, excessive drowsiness is not seen in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and medications for that condition are not indicated. None of his symptoms suggests a seizure disorder, so an EEG would not be helpful.",,

Which one of the following is most accurate regarding diagnostic evaluation by ultrasonography? ,Transvaginal ultrasonography is absolutely contraindicated for the evaluation of this patient,The bladder must be filled before diagnostic ultrasonography is performed in this patient,Transvaginal ultrasonography has a higher sensitivity and specificity for placenta previa than transabdominal ultrasonography,Ultrasonography is more useful for the diagnosis of bleeding from placental abruption than for bleeding from placenta previa,Sonographic evaluation of vaginal bleeding during pregnancy is useful only in the first trimester,,3,"The most useful and inexpensive study is transvaginal ultrasonography that provides 100% accuracy in identifying a placenta previa. Transvaginal ultrasonography has been shown to have higher sensitivity and specificity than transabdominal ultrasonography, and has been demonstrated to be a safe procedure. The angle between the cervix and the vaginal probe is sufficient to prevent probe entry into the cervix.A distended bladder is a common cause of false-positive ultrasound evaluation for placenta previa. The sensitivity of ultrasonography is lower for abruptio placenta than for placenta previa. This is true even for the abdominal approach. ",,

BCG vaccination has a limited effect on PPD reactivity; tests should not be interpreted any differently in patients who have previously received BCG. The use of a two-step approach (i.e. retesting 1-4 weeks later in patients who initially test negative) is designed to decrease the false-negative rate of PPD testing. The significance of a positive result on either phase of the test is the same. Patients who are HIV positive are at a higher risk for false-negative PPDs and active disease, but PPD testing is not contraindicated. ",,

",Supine in the mother's lap,The left lateral decubitis position on an examination table,Trendelenburg's position on an examination table,The knee-chest position on an examination table,Supine with the knees spread apart on an examination table,,4,"The knee-chest position has been found to allow for visualization of the vagina and cervix of a prepubertal child after 2 years of age without instrumentation. The vagina is filled with air when the child is in the knee-chest position, facilitating inspection. An assistant holds the child's buttocks apart and the child asked to relax her abdominal muscles and take a few deep breaths. With these preliminary steps, the vaginal orifice opens and the short vaginal canal fills with air. A bright light will help to illuminate the prepubertal child's vagina and cervix.Inspection of genitalia (where examination of the vaginal canal and cervix are not indicated) during a general physical examination need not be in the knee-chest position. In the young child (usually less than 2 years of age), examination is best done with the child lying supine in the mother's lap.

",Prescribe an oral contraceptive and have her return in 2 weeks for a pelvic examination,Delay prescribing an oral contraceptive until after you can complete a pelvic examination with STD screening,Delay prescribing an oral contraceptive until the result of a Papnicolaou smear is known,Delay prescribing an oral contraceptive until a pregnancy test is negative 2 weeks after the onset of her menses,,,1,"A history, pregnancy test (if indicated), and blood pressure reading constitute an adequate evaluation before beginning hormonal contraception. The pelvic examination may be deferred to a later visit. It is now recommended that cervical cancer screening be delayed until 3 years after the onset of vaginal intercourse, or no later than 21 years of age, neither of which have occurred in this case. However, sexually active women under the age of 25 should be screened for chlamydial infection. If a pregnancy test were necessary it could be done at the initial visit, but waiting another 2 weeks delays the initiation of birth control, increasing the risk for pregnancy. ",,

MRI should be the first step in the diagnosis of this condition, both to rule out other conditions and to identify changes suggestive of normal pressure hydrocephalus. These include enlargement of the ventricles with preservation of cerebral parenchyma. Brainstem auditory evoked response testing is used for evaluating cochlear problems. While some other features of normal pressure hydrocephalus overlap with those of depression and Parkinson's disease, this patient's constellation of signs and symptoms are more typical for normal pressure hydrocephalus.

Although it can cause hypotension or transient atrial fibrillation, adenosine is probably safer than verapamil because it disappears from the circulation within seconds. Because of its safety, many cardiologist now prefer adenosine over verapamil for treatment of hypotensive supraventricular tachycardia. Bretylium tosylate, procainamide, and lidocaine are used to treat ventricular arrhythmias. Atropine is indicated in the treatment of sinus bradycardia. ",,

The best management at this time is,Immediate cesarean section,A biophysical profile,Urinary estriol determination,A repeat nonstress test in 2 days,Human placental lactogen determination,iq197.jpg,2,"A reactive (negative) nonstress test (NST) is characterized by the presence of 2 or more accelerations of the fetal heart rate in 20 minutes or less. The accelerations must be at least 15 beats per minute above the baseline. A nonreactive NST is characterized by fewer than 2 accelerations in a 40-minute interval. A nonreactive NST is a screening test and biophysical profile (BPP) or a contraction stress test (CST) must be urgently completed to further assess fetal status. NSTs are commonly nonreactive and most CSTs and BPPs subsequently show normal results; therefore, an immediate cesarean section is unwarranted. Estriol and human placental lactogen levels take time to complete and are difficult to interpret.",,

The lesion is characterized by different shades of tan to black, and a notched irregular margin. Its appearance is more ominous and irregular than a junction nevus, and it is too brown and irregular to be the new variant of Kaposi's sarcoma. Carbon tattoos result from traumatic or self-induced imbedding of carbon particles in the skin. This produces isolated circumscribed areas of blue-black coloration.

WPW is one of the preexcitation syndromes, so-called because of the existence of one or more bypass tracts or accessory bundles through which accelerated conduction can occur. This EKG illustrates type B WPW with a QS in V1 and V2 and an R wave in leads V5 and V6.WPW syndrome is associated with paroxysmal tachyarrhythmias. On electrophyiologic testing, the individual whose EKG is shown proved to have two accessory bypass tracts and four different types of inducible supraventricular tachycardias  three reciprocating and the other an antegrade atrial flutter/atrial fibrillation at a high rate of conduction. If he were to present to the emergency department in atrial fibrillation, digoxin and verapamil would be contraindicated since they will block AV conduction but not slow down bypass tract conduction; these agents could, in fact, foment degeneration into ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.",,

Controlled prospective trials have established that it relieves variable decelerations in a majority of cases and allows the parturient to continue in labor. Its use for preventing meconium aspiration is less well established, but a Cochrane review recently favored its use for the patient in labor with a thick meconium.The procedure is not indicated for oligohydramnios or fetal growth restriction, although pregnancies with these complications have a higher risk of developing indications for amnioinfusion. Umbilical cord prolapse and amniotic fluid embolism may be complications of amnioinfusion, but this is not fully established. Late decelerations, placental abruption, hypertonic labor, and low fetal scalp pH are all contraindications to the use of amnioinfusion.",,

",Excess urine output due to hyperglycemia,Atrophic vaginitis,A grade II cystocele,Asymptomatic bacteriuria,Autonomic neuropathy,,5,"Dribbling and increased post-void residual volume (&gt; 100 mL) are signs of overflow incontinence. Overflow incontinence can be cause by outflow obstruction (e.g. prostate hypertrophy, urethral constriction, fecal impaction) or, as in this case, by detrusor muscles denervation caused by diabetic or other neuropathies. Excess urine output from hyperglycemia would result in frequent urination, but not urinary retention. Atrophic vaginitis and cystoceles are usually associated with stress incontinence. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is unlikely because the patient does not have any evidence of infection.",,

The adhesions may be partial or complete in some cases only a small pinhole orifice may be seen that allows urine to exit from the fused labia. This problem may be asymptomatic, but the patient may also have a pulling sensation, difficulty with voiding, recurrent  urinary tract infections, or vaginitis.

He recalls multiple blood transfusions following a motorcycle crash in 1988. His wife denies past liver disease, blood transfusions, and intravenous drug use. She has had no other sexual partners. The couple has three children.Which one of the following is the best advice about testing the wife and their three children? ",No testing is required in the absence of jaundice or gastrointestinal symptoms,No testing is required if her husband has normal liver enzyme levels,No testing is required because tests have low sensitivity,She should be offered testing because sexual transmission is possible,All family members should be tested because of possible household fecal-oral spread,,4,"Key risk factors for hepatitis C infection are long-term hemodialysis, intravenous drug use, blood transfusion or organ transplantation prior to 1992 and receipt of clotting factors before 1987. Sexual transmission is very low but possible, and the likelihood increase with multiple partners. The lifetime transmission risk of hepatitis C in a monogamous relationship is less than 1%, but the patient should be offered testing because she may choose to confirm that her test is negative. If the mother is seronegative, the children are at no risk. Maternal-fetal transmission is rare except in the setting of co-infection with HIV. Hepatitis C is insidious, and symptoms do not correlate with the extent of the disease. Normal liver enzyme levels do not indicate lack of infectivity. There is no risk to household contacts. Current HCV antibody tests are more than 99% sensitive and specific and are recommended for screening at-risk populations. ",,

His nose is bleeding.On examination the patient has a depression in his nose on the side of impact and an outward displacement on the opposite side. Internal inspection reveals a purple area of swelling and fluctuance on the left side of the nasal septum. The remainder of the examination demonstrates no findings to suggest other facial or periorbital trauma.Which one of the following would be most appropriate at this time? ,Immediate closed reduction of the nasal fracture,Immediate plain radiographs of the nose and orbits,Immediate CT imaging to assess for facial and mandibular fracture,"Incision and drainage of the swollen, fluctuant area","Discharge with pain medication, ice packs, and head elevation, with referral to a specialist in 1 week",,4,"The clinical examination of this patient reveals a septal hematoma  a blood-filled space between the cartilage and the supporting perichondrium. If improperly managed or left untreated, a septal hematoma may have a disastrous outcome, asthe pockets of blood easily become infected. The resulting necrosis of the underlying cartilaginous support may result in permanent saddle nose deformity. When a septal hematoma is identified, it should be aspirated immediately or incised with the aid of local anesthesia.When an uncomplicated nasal fracture is suspected, plain radiography is rarely indicated. In fact, because of poor sensitivity and specificity, plain radiograph may serve only to confuse the clinical picture. When findings such as CSF rhinorrhea, extraocular movement abnormalities, or malocclusion are present (none of which is present in this case), radiologic imaging by CT is indicated to assess for facial and mandibular fracture. Because there is no reason for early fracture reduction in this patient, follow-up evaluation and management can be safely scheduled after the swelling resolves, usually within 3-5 days. Reduction should be accomplished between the fifth and tenth day after injury, and before the nasal bones start to fixate.",,

Laboratory results usually reveal normal or minimal elevation in transaminase levels, elevated bilirubin (usually 5 mg/dL), and occasional elevations in cholesterol and triglyceride levels. It is important to recognize and diagnose this entity, as it is associated with prematurity, fetal distress, and increased perinatal mortality. Acute viral hepatitis is a common cause of jaundice in pregnancy; however, it usually does not present with severe pruritus, and transaminase levels are markedly elevated. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is another rare condition occurring in the third trimester and is usually associated with preeclampsia (50%-100% of cases).

Symptoms usually occur by the second or third day of improved nutrition, and are often multisystemic. Findings may include weakness, confusion, dysrhythmias, respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, hypotension, ileus, metabolic acidosis, seizures, coma, and sudden death. This constellation of problems results from decreased insulin secretion as stores of intracellular phosphate become depleted. Providing carbohydrates through intravenous fluids or refeeding increases insulin secretion, which stimulates cells to take up phosphate, causing severe hypophosphatemia. In this setting cells are unable to produce enough 2,3 diphosphoglycerate and adenosine triphosphate to meet metabolic demandsWhile hypoglycemia is another medical emergency, this patient's glucose level is not low enough to cause these symptoms. Similarly, renal failure of some type is present, as is an elevated creatinine kinase suggesting rhabdomyolysis; however, neither of these problems would be expected to cause this patient's symptoms. Hypocalcemia can cause multisystemic problems, including weakness and seizures, but this level is not critically low and is not associated with hypotension. ",,

Studies have shown that oral vitamin B12 at daily doses of 1000 &mu;g is effective for the treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency even in the absence of intrinsic factor (pernicious anemia), an acidic environment (gastrectomy), or terminal ileum resection (resection or damage from Crohn's disease). This high oral dose is required because doses of 500 &mu;g or less are only variably absorbed via the alternative pathway. The Schilling test is no longer needed for determining the route of therapy for vitamin B12 deficiency, as high-dose oral therapy is effective even if the stage I Schilling test is abnormal. ",,

2881,1,Medicine,"A 30-year-old schoolteacher comes to your office with an abrupt onset of fever, cough, shaking chills, and myalgias during the previous night. Earlier this week almost half of her fifth-grade students were absent from school due to respiratory illness, and the school physician has announced that the school will be closed for the next few days because of the large number of children with this illness. On examination, she has a temperature of 39.5&#730;C (103.0&#730;F), appears fatigued and ill, but is not in respiratory distress. There is no adenopathy or nasal congestion. In spite of a severe and painful cough, her chest sounds are clear.Which one of the following should be done to determine therapy? ",A chest radiograph ,A CBC and blood culture ,A cryoglobulin level ,A urinary antigen test ,No further testing ,,5,"This patient has an influenza-like illness occurring in an epidemic setting. The likelihood of influenza is so high that treatment does not need to await diagnostic testing. A positive rapid test for influenza could be helpful to document the nature of the epidemic, but a negative test is not reliable to rule out influenza in an individual patient. Also, culture results come back too late to aid in clinical decision making. Treatment is helpful only if started within 48 hours of onset.A chest radiograph, CBC, and blood culture would be useful for diagnosing pneumococcal pneumonia, which can develop as abruptly as influenza, but pneumococcal and other bacterial pneumonias are not epidemic diseases. Cryoglobulins are used for suggesting Mycoplasma pneumonia, but the test is not very reliable. Mycoplasma is contagious but does not occur in the dramatic epidemics that characterize influenza. Urinary antigen testing is useful for Legionella pneumonia, which can occur in outbreaks in older adults with COPD, but not in school-age populations. The decision to treat this patient with antiviral drugs depends on the severity of the patient's illness, the availability of the medication (which may be depleted during outbreaks), and personal and financial factors, rather than on any laboratory results.

Of the dopaminergic agents, ropinirole is the only FDA-approved treatment for RLS. Levodopa, pergolide, and pramipexole are used for RLS, but these dopaminergic agents have not been approved for this use.Long-term treatment with dopaminergic agents can lead to augmentation, with symptoms occurring earlier in the evening and spreading to the arms and trunk.Augmentation is more likely with the use of levodopa. Rebound, the occurrence of RLS early in the morning, may also be seem.

2884,1,Medicine,"A 35-year-old female jogger presents to your office with leg pain. She says it began about a month ago as an aching in the lateral aspect of the knee at the end of a run. She has continued to exercise, and now the pain is present most of the time and has moved more proximally to the lateral aspect of the thigh and lateral hip area. She denies back pain and does not recall sustaining an injury.On examination she has tenderness 2 cm above the lateral joint line of the knee, which is worse with standing with the knee flexed at 30&#730;. Back, hip, knee, and neurologic examinations are otherwise normal.The most likely diagnosis is: ",Patellofemoral syndrome ,Facet joint syndrome ,Iliotibial band syndrome ,Piriformis syndrome with referral of pain to the knee ,,,3,"Iliotibial band syndrome is a common cause of lateral knee and thigh pain. It is an overuse syndrome that begins insidiously, starting with pain over the lateral aspect of the knee and then moving more into the lateral thigh and lateral trochanteric area. The patient is tender along the iliotibial band from the knee to the hip, and the discomfort is made worse by standing with the knee flexed to 30&#730;, since this stretches the iliotibial band over the trochanter. Ober's test, lying on the uninvolved side and adducting the involved leg, causes pain in the lateral knee and thigh area because it causes the iliotibial band to tighten.Patellofemoral syndrome causes discomfort mainly on movement of the patella. Facet joint syndrome usually causes discomfort in the low back that radiate into the thigh and knee, but there should be no tenderness of the lateral thigh or knee area. Piriformis syndrome results from pressure on the sciatic nerve from inflamed piriformis muscle, causing pain in the leg in the referral pattern. However, this should not cause tenderness to the lateral thigh or knee, and Ober's test should be  normal. ",,

",A urine toxicology screen ,A serum magnesium level ,An EKG ,An EEG ,Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs ,,1,"Because polysubstance abuse is common in patients with alcohol dependence, physicians may wish to perform a urine toxicology screen in these patients. Coexisting use of other addictive substances constitutes a relative contraindication for selecting patients for alcohol withdrawal outpatient treatment. In this case, a pharmacist would have relatively easy access to other addicting substances, even though he denies using an.

The dilated esophagus with an air-fluid level and retained food on a chest radiograph is a late finding. Dysphagia and chest pain are the primary symptoms prior to esophageal dilatation. The common occurrence of heartburn leads the clinician to suspect reflux disease; however, antireflux therapy provides no relief. Despite the reported heartburn, little reflux can be verified by pH monitoring. Achalasia is best detected by functional studies, either fluoroscopy during a barium swallow or manometry.Manometry is the most sensitive diagnostic method. Endoscopy must be done because of the possibility of a malignant tumor infiltrating the gastroesophageal junction and creating a relative obstruction, as well as the achalasia syndrome. ",,
2894,1,Medicine,"A 40-year-old female presents with the gradual onset of weakness, fatigue, anorexia, and nausea. She has lost 15 lb over the past 3 months.A physical examination is unremarkable except for the patient's tired appearance, a blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, and diffuse hyperpigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes. Laboratory evaluation includes a sodium level of 130 mmol/L (N 136-145) and a potassium level of 5.8 mmol/L (N 3.5-5.1)Which one of the following is the best test to further evaluate this patient's condition? ",A TSH level ,A cosyntropin (Cortosyn) stimulation test ,A plasma ACTH level ,A dexamethasone suppression test ,,,2,"Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) is an uncommon condition in clinical practice, and typically has an autoimmune etiology. Patients often experience the insidious onset of weakness, fatigue, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Physical findings typically include hypotension and diffuse hyperpigmentation of the patient's skin and mucous membranes. Due to the loss of aldosterone, serum sodium levels tend to be low, and hyperkalemia is common.Cosyntropin is a synthetic analogue of ACTH. The cosyntropin stimulation test is performed by administering 250 &mu;g of cosyntropin intravenously or intramuscularly and measuring serum cortisol 30-60 minutes later. A normal response is serum cortisol > 500 nmol/L. A lower level suggests adrenal insufficiency.In primary adrenal insufficiency, TSH and ACTH levels may be elevated, but this is variable and ACTH continues to demonstrate diurnal variation. The dexamethasone suppression test is used in the evaluation of cortisol excess. ",,

You start intravenous fluids and ceftriaxone (rocephin) and call for emergency transport. The patient dies shortly after arrival at the hospital's emergency department. The spinal fluid from a tap done just before his death reveals a large number of polynuclear leukocytes and gram-negative diplococci.Which one of the following is true regarding control measures for this disease? ","Throat and nasopharyngeal cultures of contracts should be performed, and persons with positive cultures treated ","Since this case likely represents a sporadic one, no contacts in your community should receive prophylaxis ","Since the attack rate of this disease in household contacts is only slightly higher than that of the general population, these contacts should not receive prophylaxis ","Immunoprophylaxis with a seragroup-specific, multivalent vaccine is the management of choice for those who need treatment ","When chemoprophylaxis is indicated, ciprofloxacin (Cipro) is an acceptable agent ",,5,"The patient died of presumed Neisseria meningitidis septicemia and meningitis. Only high-risk contacts should receive prophylaxis. Throat and nasopharyngeal cultures are of no value for deciding who should receive prophylaxis. Close contacts of patients with invasive disease, whether it is a sporadic case or part of an outbreak, are at high risk and should receive prophylaxis within 24 hours of the diagnosis of the primary case. The attack rate for household contacts is >300 times higher than the rate in the general population. If the serogroup identified is contained in the vaccine (A, C, Y, or W-135), immunoprophylaxis may be useful as a secondary control measure.

The only effective strategy is to give fresh frozen plasma intravenously, restoring the vitamin K-dependent factors VII, IX, and X which are depleted in patients taking warfarin. Oral vitamin K is an effective method of reversing the effects of warfarin, but takes 24 hours to reach full effect.Packed red blood cells contain no clotting factors, and corticosteroids have no effect on the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent factors. Tissue plasminogen activator is a thrombolytic agent, and would make any serious bleeding condition worse.  ",,
2899,1,Medicine,"In persons with recurrent pulmonary embolism, which one of the following is the most common abnormality? ",Antithrombin III deficiency ,Protein C deficiency ,Protein S deficiency ,The presence of the factor V Leiden mutation ,The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies ,,4,"The routine laboratory workup for a hypercoagulable state in patients with pulmonary embolism used to include assays of antithrombin III, protein C, and protein S. However, the levels of all three of these coagulation-inhibiting proteins can be depressed during an acute thrombotic state. In addition, heparin depresses antithrombin III levels, and warfarin depresses protein C and protein S levels.Furthermore, pregnancy and the use of oral contraceptive agents cause protein S levels to decline. These proteins should not be measured routinely, because the results may be misleading and because deficiencies of antithrombin III, protein C, and protein S rarely occur. Patients with these protein deficiencies have frequent recurrences of venous thromboembolism during the first 1-3 years after the cessation of anticoagulant therapy.It is best to test for the factor V Leiden mutation because it is responsible for the most common hypercoagulable state, hyperhomocysteinemia, which can readily be treated with vitamins. It is also prudent to test for the lupus anticoagulant; if it is present, particularly intensive anticoagulation may be required. Many patients with antiphospholipid antibodies or the lupus anticoagulant do not have systemic lupus erythematosus. ",,
2900,1,Medicine,Routine monitoring of patients taking amiodarone (Cordarone) should include which one of the following? ,Thyroid function tests ,Amiodarone levels ,Chest radiographs ,Stools for occult blood ,Ophthalmologic examinations ,,1,"Liver and thyroid function testing should be performed at least every 6 months in patients taking amiodarone. The most serious potential adverse effect of amiodarone therapy is pulmonary toxicity, which may result from direct drug-induced phospholipidosis or immune-mediated hypersensitivity. The most common clinical presentation is subacute cough and progressive dyspnea, with associated patchy interstitial infiltrates on chest radiographs and reduced diffusing capacity on pulmonary function testing. A much less common presentation is adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Routine screening for ARDS is of limited value, because pulmonary toxicity can develop rapidly with no antecedent abnormalities on chest radiographs or pulmonary function tests.Thyroid toxicity is the most common complication that requires intervention. Thyroid abnormalities have been described in up to 10% of patients receiving long-term amiodarone therapy. Hyperthyroidism may result from an excess of iodine or acute thyroiditis. Hypothyroidism is 2-4 times more common than hyperthyroidism. Corneal microdeposits are visible on slit-lamp examination in nearly all patients treated with amiodarone. These deposits seldom affect vision and rarely necessitate discontinuation of the drug. Routine monitoring of the plasma amiodarone level is not recommended. ",,

Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ",Bronchiectasis ,Reactivation pulmonary tuberculosis ,Primary pulmonary tuberculosis ,Miliary tuberculosis ,,,4,"Diffuse small pulmonary nodules are characteristic of miliary tuberculosis (TB). This disease is seen commonly in those who are immunosuppressed due to alcohol abuse. Bronchiectasis may be a complication of endobronchial TB, but occurs late in the course. Reactivation pulmonary TB may also be a complication, and the radiograph typically shows localized lesions. Primary TB usually consists of hilar adenopathy and a focal infiltrate (Ghon complex). Primary TB is usually a mild process, but if it becomes severe it usually presents with extensive lobar consolidation rather than diffuse nodules. ",,

",Propranolol (Inderal) ,Potassium iodide (SSKI) ,"Verapamil (Calan, Isoptin) ",Adenosine (Adenocard) ,Diltiazem (Cardizem) ,,1,"Symptoms of hyperthyroidism including palpitations, heat intolerance, tachycardia, and tremor are largely mediated by increased adrenergic activity. Propranolol is useful for treating the symptoms of mild hyperthyroidism. It is effective in decreasing tachycardia and tremor and also has a role in the treatment of thyroid storm. At high doses it blocks conversion of T4 to T3, in addition to providing &beta;-blockade.Antithyroid agents such as propylthiouracil are useful, but require an extended period for symptom control. Potassium iodide should not be used until antithyroid therapy with an agent such as propylthiouracil has been instituted. It is most frequently used as part of the treatment of thyroid storm.Calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem and verapamil may be useful in slowing supraventricular arrhythmias by blocking conduction at the AV node. They are not useful for the adrenergically triggered sinus tachycardia of hyperthyroidism. Adenosine has similar but transient effects on the AV node. ",,

Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy is associated either with osteolysis, in which case phosphate levels are unaffected, or with elevated levels of a PTH-related peptide, which would also be associated with hypophosphatemia. Calcitonin is a weak inhibitor of PTH action and is not associated with hypercalcemia. Vitamin D increases the gastrointestinal absorption of both calcium and phosphorus; excess levels are therefore associated with elevated levels of both calcium and phosphorus. This helps to distinguish vitamin D excess from other causes of hypercalcemia. ",,

2910,1,Medicine,The most appropriate and commonly used treatment for acute pericarditis is:  ,Acetaminophen ,Dipyridamole (Persantine) ,Ibuprofen ,Prednisone ,Erythromycin ,,3,"Appropriate therapy for acute pericarditis includes NSAIDs, mainly ibuprofen, for 1-3 weeks. Other NSAIDs could be used, but corticosteroids should be avoided since they may cause a stubborn corticosteroid-dependent syndrome. A combination of ibuprofen and colchicines may be the ideal therapy. ",,

",Amoxicillin ,Azithromycin (Zithromax) ,Metronidazole (Flagyl) ,Doxycycline ,"Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra) ",,3,"This patient has mild to moderate Crohn's disease. Initial treatment should be a salicylate such as mesalamine or sulfasalazine. If her disease is not adequately controlled, metronidazole has been shown to be an effective treatment (SORT evidence level A: randomized controlled trial). Ciprofloxacin has also been shown to be effective (SORT evidence level B: lower quality randomized controlled trial). ",,
2913,1,Medicine,"A 38-year-old nurse presents with a 6-week history of nervousness, fatigue, palpitations, and reduced appetite. The physical examination is notable only for lid lag and a slight diffuse enlargement of her thyroid gland.

2915,1,Medicine,"A 60-year-old male presents with back pain. The pain began approximately 2 months ago and is located in the mid-thoracic area. The patient says he has been taking over-the-counter ibuprofen, 600 mg 4 times daily, but the pain has been increasing in intensity. It does not radiate and is worse at night after he goes to bed. He has had no chills or fever, but reports losing about 10-15 lb, which he attributes to side effects of the analgesic. He has had no bowel or bladder dysfunction.Other than well-controlled hypertension, the patient has been well. Both parents died in their mid-40s in an automobile accident. The patient does not smoke, rarely drinks alcohol, and has never used illegal drugs. For the last 20 years, the patient has worked for the city sanitation department as a manual laborer. Recently, he has found it more difficult to do his job because of the pain.Based on history alone, which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ",Spinal epidural abscess ,Self-limited musculoskeletal back strain ,Descending aortic dissection ,Abdominal aortic aneurysm ,Neoplastic disease ,,5,"Back pain is second only to upper respiratory problems as a symptom-related reason to visit a primary care physician. About 5%-10% of patients with acute back pain have manifestations of serious pathology. This patient has several red flags that a serious problem is causing his back pain. He is over 50 years old. The pain has been gradual in onset, has been present over 6 weeks, and is unrelenting despite analgesic use. It is in the thoracic spine, and is worse with recumbency, as well as at night. The patient has also lost weight. All of these findings are red flags for malignancy. The only finding present in many patients with spinal malignancy, but not in this case, is a previous history of cancer.With this history, the other diagnoses listed are much less likely. Spinal epidural abscess presents with back pain, fever, neurologic deficits, and bowel or bladder dysfunction. Injection drug use is the most common risk factor for hematogenous seeding of the spine. Musculoskeletal strain is possible, but all the red flags, especially persistence for 2 months, make this diagnosis unlikely.The textbook description of pain in aortic dissection is the instantaneous onset of chest pain that is maximal at the onset and is described as knifelike, ripping, or tearing. This is present in only 50% of patients. Dissection of the descending aorta is commonly reported as back pain. However, many patients present with symptoms attributable to secondary organ involvement (neurologic symptoms, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, or hoarseness). Common misdiagnoses for aortic dissection include musculoskeletal chest or back pain, for example.Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) presents with a history of findings such as hypertension, smoking, and/or diabetes. Symptoms include syncope or lower extremity paresthesias. Patients with AAA commonly present with back pain and are misdiagnosed as having renal colic or other nonvascular causes of back pain. ",,
2916,1,Medicine,The most significant risk factor for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage is:  ,Atrial fibrillation ,Cigarette smoking ,Excessive alcohol use ,Hyperlipidemia ,Hypertension ,,5,"Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) causes 10%-15% of all strokes, and is associated with the highest mortality. The rate of ICH is expected to double in the next 50 years as our population ages, as the incidence of ICH increases after age 55. The incidence in blacks is twice that of whites. Other risk factors include excessive alcohol use, low serum cholesterol, and low education levels. However, hypertension is the most common cause of ICH, and its most important risk factor. In patients with hypertension, the risk for ICH increases further if the patient also smokes, or is nonadherent to a medication regimen. Having hypertension also increases the risk of ICH in people younger than 55 years. While atrial fibrillation is a risk factor for stroke, it is not an independent risk factor for ICH. ",,
2917,1,Medicine,Which one of the following is true regarding osteoporosis?  ,One-third of hip fractures in persons older than 65 occur in men,All women should have a bone density measurement at the time of menopause ,Multiparity increases the risk for osteoporosis ,Controlled trials have shown that bone density screening reduces rates of osteoporotic fracture ,,,1,"Osteoporosis is becoming an increasingly important health concern in men. While women are more susceptible to osteoporosis than men, approximately one-third of hip fractures in persons older than age 65 occur in men. Recommendations for bone density screening in postmenopausal women include testing women below age 65 who have one or more risk factors for osteoporosis other than menopause. Women age 65 and older should have bone density measurement regardless of other risk factors. Risk factors for osteoporosis include petite frame, white ancestry, sedentary life style, nulliparity, smoking, high caffeine intake, alcohol use, postmenopausal status, and low calcium intake. Controlled trials have yet to prove that women who are screening for osteoporosis with bone densitometry have better outcomes than women who are not screened. In fact, having multiple risk factors for osteoporosis is a stronger predictor of hip fracture than low measured density. ",,
2918,1,Medicine,Which one of the following is most characteristic of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema? ,Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea ,Poor left ventricular function ,Brain natriuretic peptide levels >500 pg/mL ,An S3 gallop ,"A history of sepsis, trauma, or aspiration ",,5,"Increased membrane permeability in the lungs causes noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, flooding the lungs with fluid from the vascular space. Consequently, it is associated with damage to the lungs from trauma, aspiration, or sepsis.Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, an S3 gallop, and poor left ventricular function are associated with cardiac-induced pulmonary edema. Elevated brain natriuretic peptide levels mean that the cardiac walls are stretched and that the heart is likely the cause of the pulmonary edema. ",,
2919,1,Medicine,"A 45-year-old obese female presents for follow-up of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Her medications include aspirin, lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), and metformin (Glucophage). She is asymptomatic.Laboratory results include a hemoglobin A1c of 8.1%, a triglyceride level of 400 mg/dL, an AST (SGOT) level of 50 U/L (N 9-25), and an ALT (SGPT) level of 62 U/L (N 7-30).Which one of the following is most accurate regarding this patient? ",She most likely has alcoholic hepatitis ,She has metformin-related liver dysfunction ,She has nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ,She has a totally benign hypertransaminasemia ,,,3,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is frequently found in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Although generally benign, it can progress to cirrhosis in 25% of cases. The AST:ALT ratio is usually less than 1 in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and greater than 2 in alcoholic liver disease. Metformin can be useful in correcting some of the metabolic problems in this condition and does not cause liver dysfunction. ",,
2920,1,Medicine,The metabolic syndrome responds best to:  ,Thyroid hormone therapy ,Antioxidants ,Exercise and weight loss ,Rest and relaxation techniques ,An intensive insulin regimen ,,3,"The metabolic syndrome is a combination of obesity, lipid abnormalities, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. It confers a high risk for cardiovascular disease. Primary therapy includes exercise, weight loss, and dietary changes. This improves all aspects of the metabolic syndrome, mainly as a result of decreased insulin resistance. Antioxidants have no proven benefit. Thyroid hormone has no effect on metabolic syndrome unless a person is hypothyroid. Intensive insulin regimens improve glycemic control, and have no effect on other aspects of the syndrome, and may contribute to weight gain, which adversely affects the syndrome. Rest and relaxation may make one feel better psychologically, but are not a mainstay of treatment. ",,
2921,1,Medicine,"In a patient with Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which one of the following laboratory abnormalities would indicate an increased risk of death? ",Marked leukocytosis ,Thrombocytopenia ,Elevated serum creatinine ,Lymphocytic cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis ,Nonspecific ST-wave changes on an EKG ,,3,"A myriad of laboratory abnormalities may occur in Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF). These patients may have low, normal, or elevated WBC counts, normal to low platelet counts, lymphocytic cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, and nonspecific electrocardiographic findings. These usually have little diagnostic value and often result in diagnostic confusion for physicians caring for RMSF patients. Elevated serum creatinine, however, has been shown to be associated with an increased risk for a fatal outcome. Renal insufficiency of azotemia manifested by this study is likely due to glomerular and tubular damage secondary to widespread rickettsial vasculitis in the microcirculation of the kidney. ",,
2922,1,Medicine,"On an annual screen, a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus is found to have microalbuminuria. Which one of the following therapies should be initiated? ",A diuretic ,An -blocker ,A -blocker ,A calcium channel blocker ,An ACE inhibitor ,,5,"In microalbuminuric patients, blood glucose control should be improved as much as possible to delay progression to persistent proteinuria. If glycemic control is adequate and the increased urinary albumin/creatinine ratio persists, ACE inhibitor therapy should be started. Initiation of an ACE inhibitor is appropriate in both normotensive and hypertensive diabetic patients. ",,
2923,1,Medicine,Which one of the following is most predictive of the progression from mild cognitive impairment to frank Alzheimer's dementia? ,Self-reported memory deficits ,Memory deficits reported by a family member ,A normal MRI scan of the brain ,The absence of the apolipoprotein E4 allele ,,,2,Informant-reported deficits in memory and cognitive function correlate best with progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's dementia. Self-reported deficits confer a much smaller likelihood of progression. Hippocampal atrophy and the presence of the E4 allele also correlate with progression. ,,
2924,1,Medicine,Which one of the following forms of glucocorticoid therapy is most likely to result in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression? ,Split-dose oral therapy with a bedtime dose ,Morning single-dose oral therapy ,Alternate-day oral therapy ,Topical therapy ,Intra-articular injection therapy ,,1,"Late evening doses of glucocorticoid are more likely to suppress the normal early morning ACTH surge. They should be avoided because of the increased risk of suppressed adrenal secretion.One-daily morning dosing is less likely to result in adrenal suppression. If short-acting drugs such as hydrocortisone are used, the last dose of the day should not be taken after 5 pm. Alternate-day therapy is less likely to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. It is frequently less therapeutically effective. Topical and intra-articular therapy rarely result in adrenal suppression. ",,
2925,1,Medicine,Which one of the following is the most common cause of legal blindness in the elderly?  ,Diabetic retinopathy ,Macular degeneration ,Glaucoma ,Atherosclerosis ,Retinal detachment ,,2,"Macular degeneration leads the list of causes of blindness in persons over the age of 55. As the name implies, there is eventual loss of central, high-acute vision. Peripheral vision is spared. In the early form, the maculae exhibit pigment by-products called drusen. The late disease is further divided into two categories: the more common dry or atrophic macular degeneration and the exudates or wet macular degeneration. Although less common, the exudative type is more severe, and various therapies, including laser photocoagulation of neovascular vessels and photodynamic therapy, are effective in only a fraction of affected patients.The other ophthalmologic conditions listed are certainly more prevalent in the elderly, but are less common causes of blindness than macular degeneration.

2926,1,Medicine,The primary reason for treating uncomplicated streptococcal pharyngitis is to:  ,Reduce the severity of acute symptoms ,Reduce the incidence of subsequent rheumatic fever ,Reduce the risk of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis ,Prevent peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess ,Shorten the duration of illness ,,2,"In the setting of streptococcal pharyngitis, antibiotics have been shown to reduce the severity of acute symptoms, including peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess, and to shorten the duration of illness by about one day. However, it is unclear if antibiotic treatment reduces the risk of glomerulonephritis. Thus, the primary reason for treating uncomplicated streptococcal pharyngitis is to markedly reduce the subsequent rheumatic fever. ",,
2930,1,Medicine,Patients presenting with erythema multiforme often have a prodromal history of:  ,Egg allergy ,Recent immunization ,Herpes simplex infection , Thermal trauma,Streptococcal infection ,,3,Erythema multiforme is often a sequela of herpes simplex infection. Prophylaxis with acyclovir should be considered in patients with recurrent herpes-associated erythema multiforme. ,,
2931,1,Medicine,Which one of the following is most effective in slowing lung function decline in COPD? ,Theophylline ,Inhaled -agonists ,Inhaled corticosteroids ,Antibiotics ,Smoking cessation ,,5,"In patients with COPD, smoking cessation has been shown to slow the decline of lung function and even improve lung function. Theophylline, inhaled -agonists, inhaled corticosteroids, and antibiotics will not provide this benefit. ",,
2932,1,Medicine,Paraneoplastic syndromes due to ectopic hormone production are most often associated with which one of the following cancers? ,Brain ,Stomach ,Cervical ,Lung ,Colon ,,4,"Ectopic ACTH production occurs most frequently with small cell carcinomas of the lung, as does inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) production. Hypercalcemia commonly occurs with metastatic lung and breast cancer. Paraneoplastic syndromes secondary to ectopic secretion of hormones is seen with a variety of tumors, most commonly lung (especially small cell tumors), carcinoids, and pancreatic islet cell tumors.

2933,1,Medicine,"Which murmur is best heard by having a patient lean forward in a sitting position while holding his breath, preferably in expiration? ",Aortic stenosis ,Aortic insufficiency ,Mitral stenosis ,Mitral insufficiency ,Tricuspid insufficiency ,,2,"To determine that a patient does not have a murmur of aortic insufficiency, the physician must auscultate the heart with the patient leaning forward in a sitting position while holding his breath, preferably in expiration. In fact, auscultation should be performed in various positions with all patients, depending on the type of examination and the diagnostic findings anticipated. ",,
2934,1,Medicine,"A 30-year-old healthy female presents with a temperature of 38.3&#730;C (101.0&#730;F), dyspnea, nonproductive cough, bronchial breath sounds, and rales in the right mid-lung field. She has no allergies to medication or associated medical problems.This patient should receive: ",Empiric antibiotic treatment ,Antibiotics only if a chest radiograph is abnormal ,Antibiotics only if blood cultures are positive ,Antibiotics only if a sputum Gram's stain shows pathologic organisms ,No antibiotics ,,1," This patient has findings typical of community-acquired pneumonia, and thus should receive antibiotics, most likely empirically. Early in the process, a radiograph may be negative (which would be a false-negative). Sputum and blood cultures take several days for results, which would delay treatment, and are positive only in a small percentage of cases.",,
2935,1,Medicine,Which one of the following is true concerning eating disorders and bone density?  ,Oral contraceptives will correct osteoporosis ,Oligomenorrhea resulting from bulimia decreases bone density ,Normalization of weight in anorexia is the most important factor in regaining bone density ,Osteoporosis is seen in patients in their late 20s or early 30s but not in adolescents ,,,3,"The patient with anorexia is at high risk for developing osteoporosis in the adolescent years. Oral contraceptives may restore menses, but they do not help increase bone density. Oligomenorrhea in patients with bulimia does not affect bone density. In the adolescent with anorexia nervosa, normalization of body weight is the single most important factor in regaining bone density. ",,
2936,1,Medicine,Which one of the following is most accurate regarding the management of constipation in the elderly? ,"In chronic pain patients, tolerance to the constipating effects of opioids develops over time ",Constipation is a physiologic consequence of normal aging ,Stool softeners should be prescribed to chronically ill older adults ,Bulk laxatives are most useful in patients with functional (normal-transit) constipation ,,,4,"Constipation is not a physiologic consequence of normal aging. In most cases, a prophylactic laxative should be considered when prescribing opioid therapy because tolerance to the constipating effects of the opiods does not develop over time. Despite the belief that a lack of fluid increases the risk of constipation, few studies have provided evidence that hydration is associated with the incidence of constipation. Patients with functional (normal-transit) constipation benefit most from treatment with bulk laxatives. Stool softeners are ineffective in chronically ill older adults. ",,
2937,1,Medicine,A 32-year-old female sees you for a routine examination and is noted to have a 1-cm thyroid nodule. Her free thyroxine (FT4) and TSH levels are normal.Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step in managing this patient? ,Order a thyroid scan and radioactive iodine uptake level ,Refer for a fine-needle biopsy ,Refer for thyroidectomy ,Prescribe levothyroxine (Synthroid) and reevaluate in 4-6 weeks ,Prescribe propylthiouracil ,,2,A fine-needle biopsy should be the first step in evaluating euthyroid patients with a nodule. A thyroid scan and measurement of radioactive iodine uptake would be indicated in the evaluation of a patient with thyrotoxicosis to determine the functional status of the nodule and the gland as a whole. Thyroidectomy is not indicated prior to the establishment of a diagnosis. Prophylthiouracil is a treatment for hyperthyroidism and is not indicated in a euthyroid patient. The Task Force does not include the use of levothyroxine in the evaluation or treatment of thyroid nodules. ,,
2938,1,Medicine,"A 47 year old male presents with a history of profound watery diarrhea for 2 weeks. During this period, his weight has dropped from 157 lb to 148 lb. A Clostridium difficile assay is positive.Which one of the following would be most appropriate in the management of this patient? ",Amoxicillin ,Vancomycin (Vancocin) ,Metronidazole (Flagyl) ,Bacitracin methylene disalicylate ,Saccharomyces cerevisiae (brewer's yeast) ,,3,"For Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, oral metronidazole and oral vancomycin are equally effective treatments. As oral vancomycin is significantly more expensive and may select for colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci, oral metronidazole is recommended as preferred therapy. In persons with recurrent infection, the addition of the probiotic agent Saccharomyces cerevisiae reduces the risk of future recurrences. Oral bacitracin methylene disalicylate was extensively studied some 20 years ago, and while it was found to be as effective as vancomycin in reducing clinical symptoms, it was less effective in eradicating the organism or toxin from the stool and resulted in more frequent relapses. Since C. difficile colonization is thought to be due to the disruption of normal bowel flora by antibiotics, including amoxicillin, this medication would be an inappropriate choice. ",,
2939,1,Medicine,Which one of the following is true regarding the treatment of acute gout attacks?  ,"If a uric-acid lowering drug is not already being used, one should be started immediately ",Intravenous colchicines is the treatment of choice for patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease ,Generic NSAIDs are rapidly effective in most patients ,Untreated hyperuricemia is a contraindication to the use of COX-2 inhibitors ,,,3,"The preferred and most cost-effective treatment of an acute gout attack is the use of a generic NSAID such as ibuprofen or indomethacin. Colchicine, particularly the intravenous form, has the potential for serious side effects, including bone marrow suppression. Uric acid-lowering drugs do not have a role in the treatment of acute attacks. ",,

Laboratory studies are normal except for a potassium level of 5.4 mmol/L (N 3.5-5.0).Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step? ,Obtain an EKG to rule out T-wave abnormalities ,Repeat the blood sample collection ,Prescribe oral sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate) and recheck the potassium level in 2 days ,Administer intravenous calcium ,Administer intravenous insulin following by an inhaled &beta;2-agonist ,,2,"Given the absence of underlying renal problems or medication use, the most likely cause of this patient's elevated potassium level is pseudohyperkalemia. Pseudohyperkalemia occurs when the laboratory value does not accurately reflect actual serum values. The most common cause is lysis of red blood cells during phlebotomy collection. It can be excluded by repeating the blood sample collection as nontraumatically as possible.Potassium values less than 6mEq/L are not usually clinically significant and do not cause EKG changes. Treatment with sodium polystyrene sulfonate, intravenous calcium, intravenous insulin, and/or an inhaled &beta;2-agonist are necessary only if pseudohyperkalemia has been ruled out and/or there are clinical indicators such as EKG changes, a rapid rise of serum potassium, decreased renal function, and/or significant acidosis.

Salmon calcitonin is recommended for use in women with osteoporosis who are at least 5 years post menopause and cannot take other agents. Teriparatide is approved for a maximum of 2 years of use in patients with severe osteoporosis who are at high risk for fractures. It must be administrated parenterally, and the long-term effects are not known. Raloxifene has demonstrated risk reduction for vertebral fractures, but not for nonvertebral fractures. Estrogen preparations are approved for the prevention, but not the treatment of osteoporosis. Hormone therapy, however, is associated with increased risk of breast cancer, heart attack, stroke, and blood clots in the lung, risks that now appear to outweigh the benefits. ",,
2945,1,Medicine,"A 72-year-old male is brought to your office by a friend because of increasing confusion, irritability, and difficulty walking. This began shortly after the patient's car broke down and he had to walk a mile to get to a phone and call the friend.

",Confusion ,Sweating ,His temperature ,His heart rate ,His blood pressure ,,1,"Heat exhaustion and heatstroke are both on the continuum of heat-related illness. Heatstroke is a much more severe condition than heat exhaustion. Evidence of central nervous system dysfunction is evidence of heatstroke rather than heat exhaustion, even if other symptoms are not severe and point to heat exhaustion.

Moderate-to-severe disease resistant to time and diuretics usually responds to prednisone, 100-200 mg/day. Radiation to the orbits and surgery may occasionally be needed. The other treatments listed will treat only the hyperthyroidism and not the ophthalmopathy. ",,
2949,1,Medicine,"A 26 year old dental hygienist presents with severe pain associated with a blister which is filled with purulent-appearing material on the palmar aspect of the distal phalanx of her right index finger. She has a low-grade fever, and there is marked redness around the blister. You note tender right axillary adenopathy. She tells you that there were several smaller blisters in the area of the larger lesion a few days ago.Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ",Herpetic whitlow ,Paronychia ,Felon ,Pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis ,Brown recluse spider bite ,,1,"Herpetic whitlow results from inoculation of type 1 or type 2 herpes simplex virus into broken skin. Health care workers exposed to oral secretions may be susceptible. An abrupt onset of redness and significant localized pain associated with the development of small, clear vesicles is typical. The vesicles often coalesce over the next several days, and the fluid may become cloudy. Fever with epitrochlear and axillary lymphadenopathy also may occur. Herpetic whitlow may mimic other hand infections and injuries, but the history and examination usually lead to an accurate diagnosis, which may be confirmed by viral culture. ",,
2950,1,Medicine,"A 62-year-old white male presents with symptoms of intermittent claudication. The patient smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day and says he has been told in the past that he has diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure. He has not followed up on these problems with a physician because he has been too busy.On examination his blood pressure is 140/105 mm Hg, and he has findings consistent with peripheral artery disease. A laboratory workup reveals moderate hyperglycemia and elevated total and LDL cholesterol.Which one of the following would have the most significant effect on improving his symptoms of intermittent claudication? ",Control of his diabetes mellitus ,Control of his hypertension ,Treatment of his dyslipidemia ,Smoking cessation ,,,4," Cigarette smoking is the most important risk factor for intermittent claudication, which is the most common symptom of peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Intermittent claudication is described as cramping pain in the muscles of the legs with exercise, and is experienced by 2% of adults over 65 years of age. In one multi-site study of nearly 7,000 adults over 50 years of age, 29% had PVD, defined by an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of  0.9. As many as 90% of those with PVD may be asymptomatic.Cigarette smoking increases the odds for PVD by 1.4 for every 10 cigarettes smoked/day. In addition to smoking, risk factors include diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Lifestyle modification is important in the management of PVD, with smoking cessation as the single most important intervention. Exercise training can increase functional capacity by increasing walking time up to 150%. Medical management of comorbid conditions is necessary to optimize control and decrease morbidity and mortality from PVD and its complications, e.g., leg ulcers, osteomyelitis, acute limb ischemia, and amputation.The Heart Outcome Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial demonstrated that use of ramipril reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in PVD patients by 25%, regardless of the need for control of hypertension. However, data are insufficient to support the use of an ACE inhibitor in patients with PVD who are not hypertensive.",,
2951,1,Medicine,"A 59 year old female with a history of hypertension, posttraumatic stress disorder, and sarcoidosis, reports a 3-month history of hair loss in the right temple area. She has been using an over-the-counter corticosteroid cream without response. Her other medications include ramipril (Altace), hydrochlorothiazide, clonazepam (Klonopin), and bupropion (Wellbutrin). She reports increased stress from caring for her chronically ill husband who has been hospitalized recently.Examination of the skin and scalp is normal except for a 3x4-cm irregularly shaped area of alopecia with a slightly red, raised anterior edge located in the right temporal scalp. The affected skin is shiny, with no scaling; no hairs or broken hairs are present.The most likely cause of this patient's hair loss is: ",Drug-induced alopecia ,Androgenic alopecia ,Stress-induced alopecia areata ,Sarcoidosis ,Trichotillomania ,,4,"The condition of the skin in the affected area helps to differentiate the cause of hair loss. In this case, the abnormal skin suggests a scarring type of alopecia, which may be caused by infection (e.g., syphilis, tuberculosis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, herpes zoster), autoimmune disease (discoid lupus erythematosus), sarcoidosis, scalp trauma (e.g., injuries, burns), and radiation therapy. The skin is normal in androgenic alopecia, alopecia areata, and drug-induced alopecia. Trichotillomania, a compulsive plucking of one's hair, may occur in the scalp. This can be differentiated from other forms of scarring alopecia by an examination of the scalp showing decreased hair density, as well as broken hairs of various lengths, rather than complete baldness in the affected area. As the patient has known sarcoidosis, this is the most likely cause of her scarring alopecia. ",,

2953,1,Medicine,A 45-year-old male was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. He presents to your office today to begin oral antihyperglycemic therapy. Results of a fasting serum metabolic panel include the following:                                                                                 Laboratory Findings                                               Sodium136 mmol/L (N 136-145)                                               Potassium...3.7 mmol/L (N 3.5-5.1)                                               Chloride..102 mmol/L (N 98-107)                                               BUN.15 mg/dL (N 7-18)                                               Creatinine...1.7 mg/dL (N 0.6-1.3)                                               Glucose...183 mg/dLWhich one of the following medications would be contraindicated in this patient? ,Glipizide (Glucotrol) ,Acarbose (Precose) ,Metformin (Glucophage) ,Pioglitazone (Actos) ,,,3,"Maintaining good blood glucose control is important for preventing the microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus. A number of oral antihyperglycemic agents are available, but each drug class has unique adverse effects that affect their appropriateness for individual patients. In this case, the patient has evidence of renal impairment (serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL for men and 1.4 mg/dL for women). This leads to an increased risk of lactic acidosis when a biguanide such as metformin is used. Other contraindications to biguanide use include hepatic dysfunction, congestive heart failure, metabolic acidosis, dehydration, and alcoholism. The sulfonylureas include chlorpropamide (1st generation) and glipizide (2nd generation). They are associated with weight gain and hypoglycemia. -Glucosidase inhibitors (e.g., acarbose) are less effective than other drug classes as monotherapy and can be associated with gastrointestinal side effects. Thiazolidinediones (e.g., pioglitazone) are associated with weight gain, edema, and potential liver injury. ",,
2954,1,Medicine,"A 34-year-old black female has had frequent asthma exacerbations for the past several months. She uses her albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin) inhaler 4 times per week with a good response.Which one of the following is preferred for the prevention of future asthma exacerbation? ",Long-acting 2-agonists ,Leukotriene modifiers ,Inhaled corticosteroids  ,Theophylline ,No additional therapy ,,3,"This patient has mild persistent asthma and a controller medicine is indicated. The preferred treatment for patients with mild persistent asthma is low-dose inhaled corticosteroids. Alternate second-line treatments include cromolyn, leukotriene modifiers, nedocromil, and sustained-release theophylline. Long-acting 2-agonists should not be used alone for the treatment of persistent asthma. They can be used in combination with inhaled corticosteroids for initial treatment of moderate persistent asthma, but are not recommended for initial treatment of mild persistent asthma. Short-acting bronchodilators, such as albuterol, are effective for treatment of acute asthma symptoms, but should not be used as preventive treatment of patients with persistent asthma. ",,

",Carvedilol (Coreg) ,Quinapril (Accupril) ,Losartan (Cozaar) ,Atenolol (Tenormin) ,"Verapamil (Calan, Isoptin) ",,5,"Lovastatin, as well as other statin cholesterol-lowering medications, is primarily metabolized through the cytochrome P-450 system. Medications that inhibit the enzyme CYP 3A4, such as verapamil, increase serum concentrations of selected statins and subsequently increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis. ",,
2958,1,Medicine,"An 87-year-old female is hospitalized for suspected aspiration pneumonia. She has recently been having difficulty swallowing, causing her to choke and gag on both solids and liquids. The speech therapist at the hospital requests a modified barium swallow. Prior to ordering this you review her medications.Which one of these medications, listed below, is a possible cause of her dysphagia? ",Hydrochlorothiazide ,Citalopram (Celexa) ,Quinapril (Accupril) ,Digoxin (Lanoxin) ,Risperidone (Risperidal) ,,5,"Dysphagia is associated with Parkinson's disease and can also occur as a consequence of drug-induced parkinsonism. Antipsychotics are potent antidopaminergic agents and can induce symptoms that closely mimic Parkinson's disease, including dysphagia. Atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone can also cause parkinsonism and dysphagia. ",,

",,
2960,1,Medicine,Which one of the following is the most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism? ,Lithium therapy ,Parathyroid cancer ,Multiple endocrine neoplasia ,An adenoma of a single parathyroid gland ,,,4,"An adenoma of a single parathyroid gland is the cause of primary hyperparathyroidism in 85% of cases. Other fairly frequent causes are multiple adenomas and hypertrophy of all four glands. Cancer and multiple endocrine neoplasias are rare. Lithium therapy may cause hyperparathyroidism, but this is not considered primary hyperparathyroidism. ",,
2961,1,Medicine,"You are counseling a 45-year-old obese male regarding weight loss. The patient has elevated triglyceride levels, low HDL levels, and stage 1 hypertension. He does not currently take medications and would like to avoid taking medications in the future. The patient has heard good things about low-carbohydrate diets and asks your opinion about beginning such a plan.A low-carbohydrate diet in a patient such as this is most likely to result in: ",Increased LDL levels ,Increased triglyceride levels ,Increased blood pressure ,Development of the metabolic syndrome ,Better short-term weight loss than with traditional low-fat diets ,,5,"The recent public interest in low-carbohydrate diets has led to research into the potential health benefits or risks. Emerging data are mostly encouraging, in that these diets do not seem to cause the expected increases in blood pressure, LDL levels, or triglyceride levels that the medical community had first assumed. In fact, these diets seem to consistently result in more weight loss than low-fat diets, and lead to a more significant reduction in triglyceride levels. This patient has symptoms of the metabolic syndrome and has a higher risk of glucose intolerance or diabetes. Low-carbohydrate diets have been shown to reduce insulin resistance at least as well as, if not better than, traditional diet plans. More research will likely elicit any long-term effects of these diets that are not currently known. ",,
2962,1,Medicine,"In a patient with acute renal failure, the diagnosis of acute glomerulonephritis is most strongly supported by finding which one of the following in the patient's urine? ",RBC casts ,WBC casts ,Hyaline casts ,Urine myoglobin ,Urine eosinophils ,,1,"Acute renal failure (ARF) can develop over a period of days or weeks, has multiple causes, and may be prerenal, intrinsic renal (subdivided into vascular, glomerular, tubular, and interstitial), or postrenal. The clinical history and presentation of the patient are obviously very important in elucidating the cause, but the urinalysis provides valuable clues as to the type of failure. With intrarenal failure, localization to a vascular, glomerular, tubular, or interstitial focus is aided by evaluation of the urine sediment. The presence of RBC casts indicates glomerular disease, most commonly acute glomerular nephritis. This condition is clinically manifested by hypertension, edema, and hematuria.Hyaline casts are typical of a prerenal etiology, including hypovolemia or decreased circulatory volume, as in heart failure. NSAID or ACE inhibitor use may also result in prerenal ARF. WBC casts indicate acute pyelonephritis or interstitial nephritis. The latter condition should be suspected if eosinophils are found in the urine and may be due to an allergic reaction to a drug. Rhabdomyolysis is most often related to trauma or seizures, and results in circulating myoglobin which is nephrotoxic and leads to renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The urine in these patients will be heme-positive with few or no red blood cells on microscopy. ",,
2963,1,Medicine,"A 60-year-old male with a 10-year history of reasonably well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus hyperlipidemia, and hypertension presents to your office for follow-up. He complains of dyspnea on exertion and swelling of his lower legs and feet. He has not had any chest pain. His current medications include glyburide (Micronase, DiaBeta), atorvastatin (Lipitor), hydrochlorothiazide, and daily aspirin.He is moderately overweight, with a BMI of 29, and his blood pressure is 150/95 mm Hg. Examination reveals a few moist rales in both lung bases, a soft S3 heart sound, and 3+ pretibial and pedal edema. A chest radiograph reveals mild cardiomegaly and cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature. Echocardiography reveals an ejection fraction of 25%, with dyskinesia of the anterior left ventricular wall and mild mitral insufficiency.Therapeutic agents that have been shown to improve survival in such cases include all of the following, except: ","Lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril) ",Valsartan (Diovan) ,Digoxin ,Metoprolol (Lopressor) ,,,3,"This patient has systolic heart failure, most likely related to a silent myocardial infarction, and exacerbated by hypertension. Digoxin improves symptoms and decreases hospitalizations due to heart failure, but does not prolong survival. ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and -blockers have all been shown to improve survival in heart failure. ",,
2964,1,Medicine,Which one of the following electrolyte disorders may be associated with a prolonged QT interval on an EKG? ,Hyperkalemia ,Hypermagnesemia ,Hyponatremia ,Hypocalcemia ,,,4,"In addition to specific cardiac diagnoses, the EKG also provides clues to other significant underlying problems. Hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia can all cause a prolongation of the QT interval, as can type 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or severe CNS abnormalities (i.e., subarachnoid hemorrhage). The potentially lethal arrhythmia torsades de pointes (polymorphic ventricular tachycardia) is associated with the prolonged QT interval resulting from these electrolyte disorders. Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, and hypermagnesemia are not associated with prolongation of the QT interval. ",,
2965,1,Medicine,"A 25-year-old male presents 5 hours after the onset of the worst headache of my life. His temperature is 37.0C (98.6F), blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg, respiratory rate 20/min, and pulse rate 90 beats/min. The patient is lethargic but oriented; there are no focal neurologic findings, but neck stiffness is present. Unenhanced CT of the head is negative. You elect to perform a lumbar puncture.At this time, which one of the following findings in bloody spinal fluid would  indicate a diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage? ",Pink discoloration of the supernate of centrifuged spinal fluid ,A WBC:RBC ratio of 1/1000 ,A protein (mg/dL) to RBC (count/dL) of 1/1000 ,A glucose level below 40 mg/dL ,,,1,Red blood cells lyse within a few hours in cerebrospinal fluid. This imparts a pink color to the supernate of cerebrospinal fluid after centrifugation. The fluid would be clear on a traumatic tap if the spinal fluid were immediately centrifuged. CT scans will miss a small percentage of subarachnoid hemorrhages.Xanthochromia of the supernate of bloody cerebrospinal fluid requires a period of about 10 hours to develop. It would be unlikely in a patient presenting this early. It is a useful factor in distinguishing subarachnoid hemorrhage from traumatic spinal tap when the patient presents after 10 horus.The WBC:RBC ratio is more useful in diagnosing meningitis with traumatic taps. The ratio could be similar in subarachnoid hemorrhage or traumatic spinal tap. The 1:1000 ratio of mg of protein/dL to RBC/dL is a correct approximation but would not be very useful in distinguishing subarachnoid hemorrage from traumatic tap.Glucose in cerebrospinal fluid will drop with chemical meningitis caused by blood. This reduction is less than with most infections. It does not drop below a level of 40 mg/dL. ,,

She has diabetes mellitus, essential hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and chronic renal insufficiency (baseline creatinine 1.5 mg/dL).Laboratory results are significant for a potassium level of 3.4 mmol/L (N 3.5-5.1), a bicarbonate level of 19 mEq/L (N 22-26), a BUN of 78 mg/dL (N 8-25), and a serum creatinine level of 3.9 mg/dL (N 0.6-1.5). Physical examination reveals her to be awake but groggy, with a blood pressure of 88/50 mm Hg, a pulse rate of 58 beats/min, flat neck veins, clear lung fields, regular heart sounds, and no peripheral edema.You decide to admit the patient and temporarily stop all of her oral medications. A Foley catheter is placed and a small amount of clear urine with a high specific gravity obtained.Which one of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment to correct this patient's acute renal failure? ","Furosemide (Lasix), 80 mg intravenously in one dose ","Nitroglycerin intravenously, titrated as necessary ",Normal saline intravenously ,Hemodialysis ,Percutaneous catheterization of the renal pelvis ,,3,"The patient presents with acute renal failure, probably caused by a prerenal mechanism. It is likely that she became dehydrated and was unable to maintain an adequate cardiac output because of the multiple antihypertensive medications she takes. Renal parenchymal ischemia leading to intrinsic renal compromise is also possible. The findings from the Foley catheterization would rule out most causes of postrenal obstruction. Dialysis would be indicated only for chronic uremic symptoms, severe hyperkalemia, fluid overload, or more severe acidosis. In this patient, reestablishing intravascular volume with a crystalloid fluid is imperative and is usually very effective for reversing renal abnormalities.

A random finger-stick blood glucose level is 320 mg/dL.Which one of her medications listed below is most likely to be linked to her new onset of diabetes? ,Atenolol (Tenormin) ,Trazodone (Desyrel) ,Paroxetine (Paxil) ,Risperidone (Risperidal) ,,,4,"Recent data suggests a link between atypical antipsychotics and diabetes. In particular, studies have suggested an increased risk of diabetes for patients on risperidone, quetiapine, clozapine, and olanzapine. This association has been noted even in patients who do not gain weight on the antipsychotic. The other medications listed have not been implicated in diabetes.Some experts recommend checking a fasting glucose level before and soon after initiating an atypical antipsychotic. In addition, monitoring blood glucose every 3-6 months should be considered, especially in patients with other risk factors for developing diabetes. Patients with preexisting diabetes may suffer worsened glycemic control when started on an atypical antipsychotic. ",,

",Erythromycin ,Ketoconazole (Nizoral) ,"Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra) ",Clindamycin (Celocin) ,Dapsone ,,2,"Most patients with seborrheic dermatitis will respond to the usual treatment of hygiene, shampoos, and mild topical corticosteroids. However, experience with patients who are more difficult to treat, especially those with HIV infection whose dermatitis is refractory to standard topical treatment, has shown that systemic ketoconazole or fluconazole may help. Combination therapy has been recommended. Seborrheic dermatitis occurs in up to 50% of patients with HIV, and in some cases may be complicated by concomitant infection with Pityrosporum, a yeast-like fungus. The other antibiotics listed are of little value in treating this type of dermatitis. ",,

She takes no other medications.The evidence supporting a benefit from ginkgo biloba is best for which one of the following? ,Tinnitus ,Benign prostatic hyperplasia ,Dementia ,Intermittent claudication ,,,3,"Studies support the use of ginkgo biloba for tinnitus, dementia, and intermittent claudication. Those examining its use in patients with dementia are of the highest quality, and consistently demonstrate that ginkgo is more effective than placebo in delaying cognitive decline. The studies examining its use in tinnitus, claudication, and cognitive improvement in people with normal mentation are limited by bias and small numbers of studies with inconsistent results. Ginkgo is not appropriate for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. ",,

Initial management should include: ",NSAIDs alone ,NSAIDs and bed rest ,NSAIDs and corticosteroid injection ,Corticosteroid injection alone ,Corticosteroid injection and bed rest ,,1,"Nonspecific low back pain is a very common problem encountered in primary care. Patients should be evaluated for red flags such as trauma, weight loss, loss of sensation in the perineal area, bowel or bladder dysfunction, and fever, which may indicate a more serious underlying etiology. A 2006 Cochrane review showed that NSAIDs are effective for treating nonspecific, acute low back pain. An earlier Cochrane review showed that bed rest provides no pain relief for patients with low back pain. Corticosteroid injection is not indicated for the initial treatment of low back pain. ",,

",NPH ,"Regular insulin (Novolin R, Humulin R) ",Lispro (Humalog) ,Lente (insulin zinc suspension) ,Glargine (Lantus) ,,3,"The traditional bolus or mealtime insulin is regular insulin that has an onset of action within 30-60 minutes and peaks in 2-3 hours. As a result, regular insulin must be injected 30-60 minutes before meals. In order to avoid this problem, analogue insulins have been created by substituting 1-3 amino acids in the human insulin protein, which allows for altered absorption rates and more reliable absorption profiles. The analogue forms of bolus or mealtime insulin include lispro and asparte. Both of these begin acting within 15 minutes and peak in about 1 hour, mimicking normal mealtime insulin release. NPH, lente, and glargine are all basal insulins with a longer onset, peak, and duration of action. ",,

",Pityriasis rosea ,Psoriasis ,Lichen planus ,Secondary syphilis ,Tinea corporis ,figure4.jpg,3,"Lichen planus usually appears suddenly, is often associated with a low-grade fever, and is most common in middle age; women are affected more often than men. The characteristic intensely pruritic lesions are often described as purple, polygonal, and planar papules. Pityriasis rosea begins in 50%-90% of patients with a primary lesion called the herald patch, which is a scaly, oval patch a few centimeters in diameter. If it appears, it is followed in a few days by the development of scaly, erythematous patches on the trunk along cleavage planes of the skin. It rarely occurs on the proximal extremities. The lesions are usually asymptomatic with only mild itching. Secondary syphilis occurs 1-2 months after the primary lesion called the chancre. The rash usually appears a erythematous macules, a maculopapular eruption, or circular papules, but can take many forms. It tends to be widespread and includes the palms and soles. Psoriasis is characterized by a rash described as erythematous macules and plaques covered with silvery scales. Tinea corporis presents with erythematous scaly patches with raised borders, with occasional papules and sometimes pustules. ",,

There is a prolonged QRS, an rSR', downsloping ST- and T-wave inversions in V1 and V2, and a wide, slurred S wave in lead I. Left bundle branch block also causes a prolonged QRS, but very different additional findings. Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome type A causes a prolonged QRS but there is a characteristic initial slurring of the QRS (a &#8710; wave) not seen on this EKG. A shortened PR interval would also be likely. Right ventricular hypertrophy will produce an R wave in V1, but there will not be QRS widening. A true posterior myocardial infarction would also produce an R wave in V1, as well as the ST segment depression found in RBBB, but the T waves would be upright; in addition, the patient would likely be quite ill.

Some areas fluoridate their water, while others do not. In certain abutting neighborhoods, it may be difficult for the physician to tell which water system a house uses. Physicians must make sure that each family is aware of their water source.Fluoride can also be found in natural well water. If a community has pockets of natural fluoride concentration in well water, home fluoride quantitation kits should be obtained for the family and sent to the state before fluoride supplementation is begun. Topical fluoride applications are an adjunct to oral supplementation and should not take their place. ",,
2985,3,PMCH,Current recommendations suggest using which one of the following to check the pulse of an unresponsive apneic infant under 1 year of age? ,The brachial artery ,The carotid artery ,The radial artery ,The apical cardiac impulse ,,,1,"It is recommended to check the brachial pulse in unresponsive, apneic infants under 1 year of age, although the femoral pulse may be used as an alternative. The radial artery is peripheral and difficult to palpate even in a normal infant. The short,  chubby neck of infants makes rapid location of the carotid artery difficult; palpitation may also lead to inadvertent compression of the airway and stimulation of a vagal response. Checking the apical pulse is not recommended because precordial activity represents an impulse rather than a pulse. In addition, the infant's or child's precordium may be quiet, and a precordial pulse may not be palpated despite the presence of satisfactory cardiac function and a strong central pulse. ",,

He is otherwise healthy and received pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 2 years ago. You advise that he,Should receive the vaccine every 5 years ,Should receive the vaccine at age 65 ,Should receive the vaccine every 5 years only if he is living with an immuno-compromised person ,Should not receive the vaccine again , Should receive the vaccine every year,,2,"The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) is recommended for all persons age 65 or older, and for persons age 2 and older with high- risk conditions. These high-risk conditions include diabetes, heart disease, chronic liver disease (including alcoholism), chronic pulmonary disease (excluding asthma), congenital immunodeficiency, leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, renal failure, end-stage renal disease, asplenia, and HIV. Other factors associated with high risk include undergoing hemodialysis, receiving clotting factor concentrates, and taking alkylating agents or high doses of corticosteroids.For people who have received the vaccine before age 65, only one revaccination is indicated when they are 65 years of age or older and 5 or more years have elapsed since the first immunization. Antibody levels are significantly increased after this second vaccination, but do not increase after a third dose.[note: Exception - Quebec:The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine may be given from the age of 2. It is recommended for persons 65 years or over and for people aged 2 to 64 years with a medical condition that increases their risk of serious pneumococcal infection. The vaccine is usually administered only once.The following individuals have a higher risk of serious pneumococcal infection: people with a defective spleen or no spleen (due to surgery or certain illnesses), people who have undergone a cochlear implant, people who suffer from certain chronic illnesses such as heart, lung or kidney disease, diabetes or cancer, and people with a suppressed immune system.The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is safe. Most reactions are harmless and do not last long. Symptoms experienced after vaccination are not necessarily caused by the vaccine.] ",,
2987,3,PMCH,"You are on the infection control committee for your hospital. The control charts indicate an increase in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) on the surgery unit of the hospital. Based on anecdotal reports the committee has received, there apparently is poor hand hygiene on the surgery on the part of the nurses and surgeons.When making recommendations for improvements, the use of soap and water would be preferred for hand washing in which one of the following situations? ",In all situations ,"Only periodically, to remove bacteria that are not killed by alcohol-based hand rubs ",Only when health care workers are using gloves ,When alcohol-based rubs are unavailable or hands are visibly soiled ,To prevent irritation when frequent washing is required ,,4,"A key element in improving hand hygiene is the use of an alcohol-based rub instead of washing with soap and water. An alcohol-based hand rub requires less time, is microbiologically more effective and less irritating to skin than traditional hand washing with soap and water. Therefore, alcohol-based hand rubs should replace hand washing as the standard for hand hygiene in health care settings unless the hands are visibly soiled.Hand-hygiene guidelines recommend washing hands with soap and water when hands are visibly dirty or contaminated with proteinaceous material, blood, or other bodily fluids, or if exposure to Bacillus anthracis is suspected or proven. In all other clinical situations, alcohol-based rubs are recommended. ",,

The forward bending test, with or without scoliometer use, has a variable ability to detect idiopathic scoliosis. Also, there is evidence of poor follow-up in adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis who are identified during these screening programs. Fair evidence was found that only a small portion of adolescents that are treated for idiopathic scoliosis receive health benefits. Most cases of scoliosis that require aggressive treatment are likely to be detected without community screenings. ",,

It has been recommended that students entering college be offered meningococcal vaccine. This vaccine contains antigens to serotypes A, C, Y, and W-135, which cause over 75% of cases among college students. The vaccine has an efficacy of over 85% in this population group.Hepatitis A vaccine is indicated for individuals traveling abroad and men engaging in sex with men. Varicella zoster vaccine is usually given during the second year of life or to individuals without a previous history of chickenpox. Pneumococcal vaccine is given to individuals with chronic medical illnesses and at age 65. Influenza vaccine is indicated for college students, as well as the general population, but is usually administered in the late fall or early winter. ",,

Which one of the following is the correct formula for calculating NNT? ",1/(RRR + ARR) ,1/RRR ,1/ARR ,100 x ARR ,100 x RRR ,,3,"The absolute risk reduction (ARR) is the difference in the outcome event rate between the control group and the experimental group in a given study. The relative risk reduction (RRR) is the percent reduction in the measured outcome between the experimental and control groups. In evaluating a clinical study, the single most clinically useful statistic may be the number needed to treat (NNT). The NNT is the number of the patients who must be treated to prevent one adverse outcome, or the number of patients who must be treated for one patient to benefit. The NNT is simply the inverse of the ARR. Thus, 1/ARR is the correct formula for calculating NNT. ",,
2992,3,PMCH,"Currently, which one of the following is the best screening test for hereditary hemochromatosis? ",Serum iron ,Serum transferrin saturation ,Serum alkaline phosphatase ,Serum ALT (SGPT) ,HFE gene testing ,,2,"The best screening test for hereditary hemochromatosis is serum transferrin saturation, which is the calculated ratio of serum iron to total serum iron-binding capacity. An elevated serum transferring saturation is usually the earliest phenotypic expression of the disease, with a sensitivity for iron overload of 94%-98%, and a specificity of 70%-98%. In the Caucasian population these values translate into a positive predictive value of approximately 20% and a negative predictive value of 99.9%. Elevated serum ferritin generally occurs later in the course of iron overload than does elevated transferrin saturation and liver enzymes become elevated only after liver toxicity has occurred. HFE gene testing is now available, but its higher cost currently precludes using it as a screening tool, and not all cases of hereditary hemochromatosis result from the same mutation. ",,

The peripheral blood shows normochromic, normocytic anemia with Plasmodium falciparum trophozoites and schizonts involving erythrocytes, diagnostic of cerebral malaria. Treatment of this true medical emergency is intravenous quinidine gluconate. Vitamin B12 deficiency is a predominantly peripheral neuropathy seen in older adults.

You would advise him that which one of the following is generally safe? ,Baked foods such as breads ,Ice added to bottled beverages ,Fresh raw vegetables ,Fresh raw seafood products ,,,1,"Baked goods such as breads can generally be considered safe from most causes of traveler's diarrhea. Ice from local water sources is commonly contaminated, as freezing does not kill most causes of traveler's diarrhea. Raw vegetables are often contaminated because human and animal wastes are commonly used for fertilizer. Alcohol is not an effective disinfectant for traveler's diarrhea pathogens. Raw fish and shellfish are high-risk foods. ",,
2997,3,PMCH,"In a patient with elevated liver enzymes, a negative test for which one of the following makes further serologic testing for chronic hepatitis B unnecessary? ",Hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV-DNA) ,Hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) ,Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) ,Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) ,,,3,"The development of antibodies (HBcAb, HBsAb) occurs after acute infection in all patients, and can confer immunity. HBeAg may fade, even with chronic infection. HBsAg is present with acute infection, and usually disappears at 5 months. Without its continued presence, further serologic testing for chronic hepatitis B is unnecessary. In the early stages of chronic hepatitis B infection, hepatitis B viral DNA appears in the serum. This marker can disappear over time as the infection enters a non-replicated phase. These patients can develop subsequent reactivation of their infection, with concomitant deterioration of hepatic function parameters. ",,

Fair evidence was cited that screening could lead to harmful outcomes and that this risk outweighed the potential benefit of screening. (Rating of D).The incidence of ovarian cancer is higher in women over 60 years of age but it occurs throughout the age spectrum; therefore, there is no recommendation for screening particular age groups. While there is some evidence to support the screening of women with a positive family history of ovarian cancer, there is not yet sufficient evidence from ongoing clinical trials to evaluate the potential benefit of doing so.

3007,3,PMCH,Which one of the following is true concerning patient adherence? ,Most physicians can recognize when patients are nonadherent ,"Patients take complex dosing regimens more seriously, and are more likely to adhere to them ",Patient adherence tends to be highest immediately after a visit and to steadily decrease until after the next follow-up ,Self-monitoring of blood pressure improves adherence with hypertension regimens ,Pediatric patients with chronic illnesses are more compliant than adults with similar illnesses ,,4,Active participation by the patient in the selection and adjustment of a therapeutic regimen improves adherence. Self-monitoring of blood pressure increases participation and thus increases adherence to hypertension regimens.Physicians rarely identify nonadherent patients. Complicated drug regimens reduce compliance by confusing patients. Patients frequently become more adherent just before an appointment. Chronically ill pediatric patients are no more likely to be adherent than chronically ill adult patients. ,,
3009,3,PMCH,Which one of the following is true regarding direct observational therapy (DOT) in the treatment of active tuberculosis? ,DOT guarantees patient compliance with the prescribed regimen ,DOT is recommended only in the office or clinic setting ,DOT patients require less monitoring for signs of treatment failure ,DOT with incentives and reminders assures the highest treatment completion rates ,,,4,"In the treatment of active tuberculosis, direct observational therapy (DOT) involves providing the antituberculosis drugs directly to patients and watching them swallow the medications. It is the preferred care management strategy for all patients with tuberculosis. The use of DOT does no guarantee the ingestion of all doses of every medication, as patients may miss appointments, may not actually swallow the pills, or may (deliberately or otherwise) regurgitate the medication.Research has shown that DOT cannot be limited merely to passive observation of medication ingestion. There must be aggressive interventions when patients miss doses. DOT should be used for all patients residing in institutional settings, such as hospitals, nursing homes, or correctional facilities, or other settings, such as methadone treatment sites, that are conducive to observational therapy. Because DOT does not guarantee complete compliance with an antituberculosis regimen, all patients should continue to be monitored for signs of treatment failure. Enhanced DOT (DOT along with incentives and enablers) produces the highest treatment completions rates (in excess of 90% across a range of geographic and socioeconomic settings), and reinforces the importance of patient-related factors in designing and implementing case management. Examples of enablers are reminder systems and follow-up for missed appointments, as well as personnel who speak the languages of the populations served. Incentives include such things as clothing or personal products, as well as use of a patient contract. ",,
3010,3,PMCH,"In April 2003, guidelines for internal compliance programs at pharmaceutical companies were issued. According to these guidelines, which one of the following is likely to be considered appropriate? ",Compensating physicians for attending a continuing medical education (CME) activity ,Requiring that CME activities be organized by the marketing department of the company ,Requiring inclusion of product endorsements in CME activities ,Requiring that speakers for the CME activities be selected from a company-approved list ,Requiring disclosure of sponsorship of CME activities ,,5,"In 2003, guidelines for internal compliance programs at pharmaceutical companies were issued, providing information about practices likely to provoke government prosecution under current law. With regard to sponsorship of continuing medical education (CME) activities, the OIG recommends disclosure of industry sponsorship and potential conflicts of interest. Unacceptable industry practices include compensating physicians for attending CME activities, as well as influencing the choice of speakers and content of CME activities. The OIG recommends separating CME functions and the awarding of grants from the sales and marketing divisions of a company. ",,
3011,4,Pediatrics,A 15-year-old white female is brought to you by her parents. They report a 30-lb (14-kg) weight loss over the last 10-12 months; her current weight is 39 kg (86 lb). The patient denies any problem exists and says she is very active in school activities and simply doesn't fell hungry. The patient is extremely thin; the physical examination is otherwise normal. The most likely diagnosis at this time is: ,Hyperthyroidism ,Diabetes mellitus ,Anorexia nervosa ,Occult neoplasm ,Addison's disease ,,3,"Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder seen mainly in young women, usually beginning in adolescence. There are no specific tests to confirm the diagnosis. Findings include refusal to maintain normal weight, denial of any physical problems, amenorrhea, and the absence of findings that suggest organic illness. There may be several physical and laboratory abnormalities, but these are not consistent with other diagnoses.The lack of specific findings on the history and examination rules out the other problems listed. Hyperthyroidism might be suspected if the pulse rate were high. In anorexia nervosa the pulse is frequently slower than normal. Diabetes severe enough to produce such large amounts of weight loss would present with the classic symptoms of polyphagia, polydipsia, and polyuria. Addison's disease would produce skin pigmentation changes that would be apparent on examination. Occult neoplasms would produce some subjective symptoms such as fatigue or malaise. ",,
3012,4,Pediatrics,"A 2 year old male is brought in for an initial office visit. He just moved to your community to live with foster parents. On examination, you note a thin upper lip, a smooth philtrum, a flat nasal bridge, small palpebral fissures, &ldquo;railroad tract&rdquo; ears, a curved fifth finger (clinodactyly), and a widened upper palmar crease that ends between the second and third fingers.These findings suggest which one of the following? ",Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) ,Marfan syndrome ,Oligohydramnios sequence (Potter's syndrome) ,Fetal alcohol syndrome ,Prader-Willi syndrome ,,4,"The child described has the characteristic facial features of fetal alcohol syndrome. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are caused by the effects of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Fetal alcohol syndrome is the most clinically recognized form of FASD and is characterized by a pattern of minor facial anomalies, including a thin upper lip, a smooth philtrum, and a flat nasal bridge; other physical anomalies, such as clinodactyly; prenatal and postnatal growth retardation; and functional or structural central nervous system abnormalities.Children with Down syndrome have hypotonia, a flat face, upward and slanted palpebral fissures and epicanthic folds, and speckled irises (Brushfield spots); varying degrees of mental and growth retardation; dysplasia of the pelvis; cardiac malformations; a simian crease; short, broad hands; hypoplasia of the middle phalanx of the 5th finger; and a high, arched palate.Marfan syndrome is characterized by pectus carinatum or pectus excavatum, an arm span to height ratio &gt;1.05, a positive wrist and thumb sigh, limited elbow extension, pes planus, and aortic ascendens dilation with or without aortic regurgitation.The bilateral renal agenesis seen with Potter's syndrome is incompatible with extrauterine life. Other anomalies include widely separated eyes with epicanthic folds, low-set ears, a broad and flat nose, a receding chin, and limb anomalies.Finally, Prader-Willi syndrome is characterized by severe hypotonia at birth, obesity, short stature (responsive to growth hormone), small hands and feet, hypogonadism, and mental retardation.

3013,4,Pediatrics,"A mother brings her 3-year-old son to the office for follow-up one day after his first tonic-clonic seizure. The mother brought the child to the emergency department directly after the event for evaluation. The child had not been ill previously, and no fever was present. A CBC, blood chemistries, non-contrast CT, and spinal tap were normal. In the office today the child's medical history is unremarkable, as is his physical examination, including developmental milestones and a thorough neurologic examination.Which one of the following would be most useful in assessing this patient's condition? ",Arterial blood gas levels ,Urine toxicology screening,A chromosomal analysis ,An EEG ,MRI of the brain ,,4,"Seizures are a relatively common disorder in children, occurring in 4%-8% of the population by the age of 20. Your response to a seizure is threefold: 1) reacting to the event itself; 2) establishing an etiology; and 3) arriving at appropriate treatment. The patient in this scenario has already been managed for the acute event. The seizure appears to have been a single, limited event that has no emergent features such as meningitis or status epilepticus. When evaluating a patient who has just experienced a seizure, you should first verify that the patient has normal vital signs and adequate oxygenation and that there is no further seizure activity. A complete laboratory evaluation of a child with the new onset of seizures includes a complete blood count; measurement of blood chemistries, including glucose, calcium, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, urea, nitrogen, creatinine, magnesium and phosphorus; blood or urine toxicology screening; analysis of CSF; and EEG and brain imaging (MRI). Glucose abnormalities and hyponatremia are the most common laboratory findings associated with seizures.Electroencephalography (EEG) is recommended for all patients with new-onset seizures. Most other patients with a first seizure can receive EEG testing at a scheduled follow-up visit. Although EEG within 24 to 48 hours of a seizure is more likely to show an abnormality, some early abnormalities, such as postictal slowing, may not be significant. ",,
3014,4,Pediatrics,"A mother meets you in the emergency department with her 3-week-old infant. The infant was delivered at term, with an uneventful prenatal and postnatal course to this point. The mother reports that the infant stopped breathing for 20-25 seconds, and that his lips and tongue appeared bluish. There was no coughing, choking, or congestion, but the child seemed limp. The episode ended when the mother vigorously stimulated her child and he started crying. On examination, the child appears normal.Which one of the following would be most appropriate in this situation? ",The mother should be reassured and the infant should be discharged to home ,The infant should be released with a home apnea monitor ,The infant should be admitted to the hospital for observation ,A referral to child protective services is mandatory ,Direct laryngoscopy to rule out a foreign body is routinely indicated ,,3,"Some experts recommend inpatient observation for all children with apparent life-threatening events such as this. It is generally advised, however, that for a short, self-correcting episode associated with feeding, hospital admission is not always necessary. Otherwise, the child should be admitted for observation and evaluation. Although child abuse is a concern, referral to child protective services is not mandatory. Laryngoscopy would not be routine, but might be appropriate depending on the history and physical examination. Many groups recommend home apnea monitoring after discharge for those with more severe or undiagnosed cases. ",,
3015,4,Pediatrics,Metered-dose inhaler (MDI) and/or nebulizers can be used to administer short-acting 2 agonists for treating acute asthma exacerbations in children. Which one of the following is true regarding these delivery methods? ,The use of nebulizers is associated with lower pulse rates than use of an MDI with a spacer ,Children must be capable of understanding and following simple instructions for effective use of MDIs with spacers ,"MDIs with spacers are as effective as nebulizers, and treatment costs are lower ",Nebulizer treatment results in a statistically significant reduction in length of stay in the emergency department when compared to treatment with MDIs ,The use of MDIs with spacers must be limited to a maximum of 2 puffs every 6 hours in children ,,3,"The treatment of acute asthma exacerbations in children using 2 agonists delivered by metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) with spacers has been shown to be as effective as nebulized administration. The use of MDIs with spacers in this clinical setting has the advantage of lower costs, lower increases in pulse rate, and shorter emergency department stays. MDIs with spacers have been used successfully in children as young as 10 months of age and at doses as high as 10 puffs at once.  ",,
3016,4,Pediatrics,A mother calls your office regarding her 14-month-old son who has fallen against a door and completely avulsed a lower front tooth. The child is otherwise healthy. There is no dentist available for consultation.Which one of the following would be the most appropriate advice? ,Reimplant the tooth as soon as possible ,Reimplant the tooth as soon as possible only if the child is no longer bottle fed ,Reimplant the tooth as soon as possible and begin antibiotic therapy ,Do not reimplant the tooth ,,,4,"Dental injuries are very common in childhood. If a primary tooth is completely avulsed, it should NOT be reimplanted, as this may cause injury to the developing tooth bud. The tooth should be examined to make sure that the entire root and crown are present. Radiographs may be needed if there is concern that the tooth was aspirated, swallowed, or impacted against the alveolus. If the physician is concerned that an injured, but incompletely avulsed, tooth may be aspirated, he or she can remove the tooth if a dentist is not immediately available. This is of particular concern if a child is still bottle fed.  ",,

She asks if she can use DEET (N, N diethyl-m-toluamide) on her child.Which one of the following would be the most appropriate advice? ",DEET is not considered safe in children less than 1 year of age ,DEET is not considered safe for anyone less than 18 months of age ,DEET at a concentration of 10%-30% is safe for children over 2 months of age ,DEET at a 50% concentration is more effective than a 30% concentration ,,,3,DEET is safe to use in children over 2 months of age and is associated with a very rare incidence of major adverse effects (strength of recommendation C). Concentrations between 10% and 30% prolong the duration of action. At 30% the efficacy plateaus. Use of DEET at concentrations above 50% is neither more efficacious nor recommended. ,,

The parents are not overly concerned, but want to know what should be done. The child seems to understand his situation, is in charge of cleaning his bed, and seems unconcerned about the problem.After a thorough examination and discussion of the options, the most appropriate recommendation in this case would be: ",Desmopressin nasal spray (DDAVP) at night ,Behavioral and cognitive therapy ,Motivational therapy ,"The bell and pad alarm system, and if unsuccessful, another attempt in 3 months ",Watchful waiting until the child and parents are motivated ,,5,"Primary nocturnal enuresis is a common condition for which there are many options. Treatment depends on the motivation of the parents and the child. Many times, parents and children just need reassurance that the condition is benign and that nothing needs to be done, especially for children under the age of 7.As the child gets older and expresses an interest in tackling the problem, treatment should be initiated. Options include motivational training, bladder training, fluid management, use of an alarm clock 2-3 hours after going to bed, enuresis alarms, and desmopression spray or pills. Research indicates that all of these options are effective. However, the enuresis alarms have been shown to be the most successful treatment in the long run. Desmopression has also been successful, but relapses are frequent when it is discontinued.  ",,

The spectrum of renal disease varies from microscopic hematuria to a nephritis or nephritic syndrome with renal failure. Overall, 2%-5% progress to end-stage renal failure. Gastrointestinal tract disease occurs in approximately two-thirds of children, varying from colicky pain to intestinal hemorrhage and intussusception. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is not a recognized complication of the disease, although both seizures and coma are rare CNS complications. Pancreatitis and cardiac involvement are also rare complications. Joint involvement occurs in 60%-84% of children, but is transient and leaves no permanent deformity. ",,

She is in the middle of the season and does not wish to quit or decrease her activity level.A physical examination is negative except for mild tenderness over the affected area. Palpation of the posterior medial aspect of the tibia is negative and there is no point tenderness along the anterior or posterior medial tibia.Which one of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis? ,A bone scan ,MRI of the lumbar spine ,Nerve conduction velocity testing ,Angiography of the popliteal artery ,Measurement of compartmental pressures ,,5,"Chronic compartment syndrome is becoming more frequently recognized. It tends to affect young athletes, particularly girls, and is more common in runners and soccer players. The most common compartments involved are the anterior and deep posterior compartments. Symptoms appear to be due to the increase in blood volume and edema which occurs with exercise, increasing muscle mass by up to 20%. The resulting elevated pressure within the compartment leads to diminished capillary flow and tissue ischemia, causing pain which is not usually severe.The pain tends to recur at a specific distance and usually resolves within minutes to hours after stopping the activity. Physical examination may reveal tenderness over the involved compartment, but is often negative. The examination does help rule out other entities such as shin splints, stress fracture, claudication, disc herniation, popliteal artery entrapment, peroneal nerve entrapment, and gastrocnemius strain. The diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the pressure in the involved compartment. ",,

The incidence of congenital anomalies is increased threefold in infants of diabetic mothers, most notably cardiac and CNS defects. There is good evidence that tight glycemic control in early pregnancy decreases the risk of anomalies. The anomaly rate increases as the glycohemoglobin level increases. In order to improve this, preconception diabetic care must be strict.Sepsis, hypoglycemia, birth trauma, and macrosomia are all increased in infants of diabetic mothers. However, associated congenital anomalies are more likely to cause perinatal mortality. ",,

3038,4,Pediatrics,"A 2-month-old black male is rushed into the office. About 30 minutes earlier, the mother had found him &ldquo;not breathing&rdquo;. He was aroused with stimulation. The mother reports that he had not been sick, and in fact, has seemed normal since the incidence. The mother is well known to you, and is known to have abused alcohol during the past. Your examination, including thorough cardiac and neurologic evaluations, is within normal limits. Based on your presumptive diagnosis, which one of the following should be included in your recommendations to reduce the risk of a more serious episode? ",Having the infant sleep in the mother's bed for the next few weeks ,Placing the baby in the prone position to sleep ,Avoiding exposure of the baby to secondhand tobacco smoke ,Discouraging the use of a pacifier at nap time and bedtime ,Being sure the child is warmly dressed for sleep ,,3,"An aborted episode of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the presumptive diagnosis in this case. SIDS has its peak incidence in infants 2-3 months of age. Black, Native-American, and Alaskan Native children have rates of SIDS that are 2-3 times the national average.Bed sharing can be dangerous under certain conditions; the risk of SIDS seems to be particularly high when there are multiple bed sharers and also may be increased when the bed sharer has consumed alcohol or is overtired. On the other hand, room sharing (i.e., the infant sleeping in the parent's room) without bed sharing is associated with a reduced risk of SIDS. Accordingly, new recommendations for preventing SIDS have been released. Regarding bed sharing, the AAP recommends that infants 1) should have a separate but proximate sleeping environment; 2) may be brought into the parent's bed for nursing or comforting, but should be returned to their own crib or bassinet when the parent is ready to return to sleep; and 3) should not be brought into bed when the parent is excessively tired or using medications or substances that could impair his or her alertness. Thus, in the case described, it would unwise to recommend bed sharing.The other items listed are in the recommendations. Regarding the use of pacifier, several studies have reported its use has a protective effect on the incidence of SIDS. It was concluded that &ldquo;nonnutritive sucking behaviors&rdquo; (i.e., finger or pacifier) are normal in infants and young children, and in most cases, sucking habits in children up to the age of 5 years are not likely to cause long-term difficulties.

Over the past 3 days the father has noted reduced physical activity and a slight limp. There is no known history of trauma and the child has otherwise been well. There is no fever, and a physical examination is remarkable only for the presence of slight flexion, abduction, and external rotation of the left hip. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is normal.Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ",Transient (toxic) synovitis ,Growing pains ,Benign osteoid osteoma ,Septic arthritis ,Legg-Calv&eacute;-Perthes disease ,,1,"Transient (toxic) synovitis and septic arthritis of the hip present acutely with pain and activity limitation. These conditions tend to affect younger children compared to osteomas, growing pains, and Legg-Calv&eacute;-Perthes disease. The classic patient is a 6-year-old male who is otherwise healthy with no trauma history. There may be a low-grade fever, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is normal. On presentation there is limited pain and spasm.Septic arthritis has a more severe presentation, with the patient's temperature likely to be >38&#730;C, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate >20 mm/h, and severe tenderness present on palpitation. Growing pains are idiopathic leg pains that affect children 3-12 years of age, with symptoms including nocturnal leg pains and restlessness that may awaken the child from sleep. Both Legg-Calv&eacute;-Perthes disease and benign osteoid osteoma have more protracted clinical presentations, with the pain developing more gradually. Pain is the prominent symptom of osteoid osteoma have more protracted presentations, with the pain developing more gradually. Pain is the prominent symptom of osteoid osteoma, with nocturnal accentuation. ",,
3040,4,Pediatrics,"For several months you have been evaluating a 2 1/2 year old male whose parents have numerous concerns. The patient has extreme difficulty mixing with other children, preferring to be alone. He is quite aloof around others, gesturing or pointing instead of using words. He also throws extreme tantrums for no apparent reason. The child does not respond to regular verbal cues and often simply ignores others when spoken to. His vocabulary is less than 10 words and he has never put two words together. Hearing screening tests and an EEG are normal.Which one of the following is true regarding this patient's disorder? ",Pathologic parenting is most likely responsible for this etiology ,"Immunizations, particularly MMR, may precipitate the disorder ",Biologic markers are useful for making the diagnosis ,The development of specific impairments is varied and unpredictable ,Behavioral modification programs are not helpful ,,4,"Autism is a pervasive condition affecting 7 out of 10,000 persons. Defined behaviorally as a syndrome consisting of abnormal development of social skills, sensorimotor deficits, and limitations in the use of interactive language, it is characterized by variable development, resulting in good skills in some areas and poor skills in others. No single cause has been linked to the development of autism. Studies have failed to show an association between any vaccine and the disorder. To date, no biologic markers are available to aid in the identification of patients with autism. Successful programs in the treatment of autism include behavioral modification strategies as well as programs emphasizing the development of social communication and early, active, and consistent family participation.

The patient is unable to sit normally because of her pain. She has an exquisitely tender red mass in the posterior right labia majora. It is oval in shape, with the largest dimension being about 6 cm.The treatment of choice for this condition would be ",Marsupialization of the lesion ,Surgical excision ,Antibiotic therapy ,Incision and packing with iodoform gauze ,Insertion of a Word catheter ,,5,"The patient has a Bartholin's abscess. Marsupialization can be used for a Bartholin's cyst, but is not appropriate for an acutely infection lesion like the one presented. Surgical incision is used for recurrent, but not acutely infected, cysts. Incision and drainage alone relieves the immediate pain, but is associated with a very high recurrence rate. As is the case with other abscesses, antibiotic therapy is not effective for a Bartholin's abscess. Incision of the lesion, followed by insertion of a Word catheter, creates a long-lasting drainage tract and usually cures the problem permanently. ",,

The patient is at 14 weeks estimated gestational age by last menstrual period, and ultrasonography at 8 weeks gestation was consistent with these dates. Fetal heart tones are not heard by handheld Doppler. Transvaginal ultrasonography reveals an intrauterine fetus without evidence of fetal cardiac activity. The patient has not had any bleeding or cramping, and otherwise feels fine. A pelvic examination reveals a closed cervix without any signs of bleeding or products of conception.Which one of the following is the most likely cause of this presentation? ",Inaccurate dating ,An inevitable abortion ,A missed abortion ,A blighted ovum ,,,3,"In this case, the patient has a missed abortion, which is defined as a dead fetus or embryo without passage of tissue and with a closed cervix. This condition often presents with failure to detect fetal heart tones or a lack of growth in uterine size. By 14 weeks estimated gestational age, fetal heart tones should be detected by both handheld Doppler and ultrasonography. An inevitable abortion presents with a dilated cervix, but no passage of fetal tissue. A blighted ovum involves failure of the embryo to develop, despite the presence of a gestational sac and placental tissue. ",,
3044,2,OBGYN,"A 48-year-old female who recently relocated to your area presents as a new patient. A review of her medical records reveals that she underwent a right mastectomy 1 year ago for a 1.5 cm invasive ductal carcinoma. The procedure included axillary lymph node dissection and all nodes studied were reported as negative for tumor. She received a course of radiation therapy and chemotherapy and has been advised to continue a tamoxifen (Nolvadex) regimen for a total of 5 years. She had a negative mammogram, physical examination, and Papanicolaou (Pap) test just prior to moving last month, and has been faithfully performing monthly self-examination of her surgical site and left breast. According to current recommendations, which one of the following surveillance methods would be most appropriate in addition to mammography for this patient? ",Annual bone scans ,Blood tests for tumor markers ,Liver function tests every 4 months ,A chest radiograph every 6 months ,A history and physical examination every 6 months ,,5,"Breast cancer survivors have an increased chance of developing a second malignancy, compounding their risk of recurrence and metastatic spread of the treated malignancy. Additionally, treatment with some medications may increase risks of future problems, as is the case with tamoxifen treatment, which may increase the risk of endometrial cancer. There has been no documented improvement in either survival or quality of life when intensive laboratory and radiographic studies are obtained routinely. Currently accepted recommendations for routine surveillance after breast cancer surgery include monthly breast self-examination, annual mammography, and a careful history and physical examination every 6 months for the first 5 years and annually thereafter.

On a few occasions, she has been unable to get to the toilet in time and notes the loss of urine to be &ldquo;more than a dribble&rdquo;. She has researched the problem on the Internet and wants you to prescribe the best treatment.Which one of the following would be the best treatment for this patient's incontinence? ",Oxybutynin + Kegel exercises,Pseudeoephedrine + Bladder retraining,Topical estrogen,Imipramine + Kegel exercises,Pelvic muscle rehabilitation and decreasing caffeinated beverages,,1,"Urge incontinence is characterized by urinary urgency and frequency, often resulting in uncontrollable bladder contractions with large-volume urine loss. Stress incontinence is brought on by a sudden increase in intra-abdominal pressure associated with coughing, sneezing, or laughing. Urine volume is small, as urine loss occurs only during the strain.Although the selective anticholinergic medicine tolterodine and the older nonselective oxybutynin are often prescribed as initial therapy for urge incontinence, behavioral therapy is the treatment of choice, including bladder training and pelvic floor muscle (Kegel) exercises. Kegel exercises are particularly useful, and randomized, controlled trials have consistently shown them to be more effective than anticholinergic medication in the treatment of urge incontinence.  Greater success rates are achieved when different treatment modalities such as behavior modification and pharmacological therapy are combined.Topical estrogens, &alpha;-adrenergic agonists and Imipramine (a tricyclic antidepressant) have been used with inconsistent results in the treatment of stress incontinence.

3046,2,OBGYN,The most common cause of jaundice in pregnancy is ,HELLP syndrome ,Acute fatty liver of pregnancy ,Acute cholelithiasis ,Acute viral hepatitis ,Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy ,,4,"Viral hepatitis is the most common cause of jaundice in pregnancy, accounting for 50% of all cases. This is important to recognize, as it should be considered first in the differential diagnosis of jaundice and elevated transaminase levels, in particular ALT. In this situation, the diagnosis can be made or excluded by ordering serologic tests for hepatitis. If these are negative, further evaluation for more infrequent causes of jaundice in pregnancy should be pursued.HELLP syndrome is associated with preeclampsia and is rare, occurring in 0.1% of all pregnancies. It presents with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy presents as a complication of preeclampsia and occurs in 1 in 13,000 pregnancies. Acute cholelithiasis usually does not present with jaundice, but with right upper quadrant pain. Jaundice does occur, however, if choledocholithiasis is present. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is also rare, occurring in 0.01% of all pregnancies. This presents with pruritis and/or jaundice. ",,

Of the following alternative approaches that have been studied, the one with the best evidence of effectiveness for this problem is ",Glyceryl trinitrate ,Fish oil supplements ,Spinal manipulation ,Behavioral interventions such as exercise,Surgical interruption of pelvic nerves.,,2,"NSAIDs are the initial therapy of choice for primary dysmenorrheal (strength of recommendation A). Treatments supported by limited-quality, patient-oriented evidence (strength of recommendation B) includes oral contraceptives, depot medroxyprogesterone, acupuncture, fish oil supplements, low-fat vegetarian diets, thiamine, toki-shakyaku-san (a Japanese herbal product), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and vitamin E. Measures of uncertain effectiveness (strength of recommendation B) include behavioral interventions such as exercise, surgical interruption of pelvic nerves, and the use of glyceryl triniate, nifedipine, and terbutaline. Spinal manipulation has been shown to be ineffective (strength of recommendation B). ",,
3048,2,OBGYN,"A 23-year-old white female has a 10-year history of headaches. She reports no preceding illness or injury, and no obvious precipitating event. Her mother and older sister also have headaches. On average, she has one to two attacks of right or left hemicranial throbbing headaches every month. The pain intensifies with almost any physical activity, and some attacks are so severe she has to stay home. A typical attack begins gradually, reaches peak intensity in 2-3 hours, and lasts 1-2 days if not adequately treated. There is accompanying sensitivity to light and sound, and often nausea and vomiting. She says that nearly all of the attacks occur within 2 days before or after the first day of menstruation. Other identifiable triggers include stress, hunger, strong smells, and foods high in monosodium glutamate.Which one of the following would be the preferred medication for this patient's headaches? ",Hydrochlorothiazide ,&alpha;-Tocopherol (vitamin E) ,Medroxyprogesterone (Provera) ,Bromocriptine (Parlodel) ,Ibuprofen ,,5,"Menstrual migraine begins at menarche in one-third of affected women. It occurs mainly at the time of menses in many women and exclusively with menses in some. Menstrual migraine is usually not associated with aura and often lasts longer than nonmenstrual migraine. The headaches occur just before or during menses as a result of estrogen withdrawal, mediated by prostaglandins. NSAIDs are effective first-line treatment, because they inhibit prostaglandin synthesis or block prostaglandin receptors. If the initial NSAID is ineffective, other classes of NSAIDs should be tried. When headaches cannot be controlled with NSAIDs, a 5-HT agonist (triptan) may be used. Diuretics and vitamins are popular but ineffective treatments. Estrogens, with or without progesterone, can be used as preventive treatment, but progesterones alone will not prevent migraines. ",,

She has abrasions on the left forearm and left leg and otherwise appears uninjured. Which one of the following would be the most sensitive indicator of fetal compromise in this patient? ,Continuous electronic fetal monitoring ,Uterine ultrasonography ,Vaginal bleeding ,Uterine tenderness ,Frequent uterine contractions ,,1,"Trauma complicates 6%-7% of pregnancies. Risk factors associated with significant risk for fetal deaths include motorcycle and pedestrian collisions, maternal tachycardia, abnormal fetal heart rate, lack of restraint use, serious maternal injury, and vehicle ejections.Electronic fetal monitoring is the most sensitive indicator of fetal compromise. There is some controversy as to the length of monitoring needed, with reports of delayed fetal death or placental abruption after short monitoring periods (6 hours), leading most experts to recommend continuous monitoring for 24 hours. Clinical signs and symptoms such as vaginal bleeding, uterine tenderness, and the presence of frequent uterine contractions are not reliable indicators of 	fetal well being. Likewise, uterine ultrasonography is not sensitive for predicting placental abruption, and therefore, fetal compromise. ",,
3050,2,OBGYN,A 58-year-old female sees you for a routine annual visit. She has had a hysterectomy for endometriosis. She asks you if she needs a Papanicolaou (Pap) test.Which one of the following would be appropriate advice regarding Pap tests for this patient? ,Screening is not needed ,Screening should be performed every year until she is 70 ,Screening should be performed every 3 years ,Screening is recommended only if she has a positive family history of cervical or ovarian cancer ,,,1,"Current guidelines recommend against Papanicolaou (Pap) smear screening in women who have had a hysterectomy for benign disease. An effort should be made to confirm that the cervix was completely removed and that the pathology from the hysterectomy was benign. In women who have a past history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3, or in cases where it cannot be confirmed that the hysterectomy was NOT performed for CIN 2/3, screening should be performed until three consecutive, adequately performed Pap tests are negative. Women who had a subtotal hysterectomy and still have a cervix should continue to be screened. In addition, women with a history or diethylstilbestrol exposure in utero, or with a history of cervical cancer, should continue to be screened. ",,
3051,2,OBGYN,Maternal parvovirus B19 poses which one of the following risks to the fetus? ,Hydrops ,Laryngeal papillomas ,Chronic active hepatitis ,Seizures ,Pneumonia ,,1,"Maternal parvovirus B19 infection poses several risks to the fetus and newborn. The virus readily crosses the placenta, but transplacental transmission is not known to cause congenital defects, even during early pregnancy infections. Early pregnancy infection is associated with a high rate of spontaneous abortion, usually in 1-10 weeks after maternal infection. Infection later in pregnancy may destroy immature red blood cells in the fetus, causing anemia, which may lead to non-immune hydrops due to heart failure; it may also lead to fetal death. The degree of fetal illness is unpredictable, and most women with prenatal infection deliver healthy infants. ",,
3052,2,OBGYN,"A 25 year old black female at 32 weeks gestation is found to have a blood pressure of 170/100 mm Hg during a prenatal visit. Previously, her blood pressure had been normal. Although her blood pressure remains elevated during the remainder of her pregnancy, she denies any headaches, visual symptoms, chest pain, dyspnea, or abdominal pain. She develops edema, but does not have proteinuria. Her delivery is uneventful, and her blood pressure at her first postpartum visit is 124/78 mm Hg.This patient most likely had ",Mild preelampsia ,Severe preeclampsia ,Gestational hypertension ,Eclampsia,Preeclampsia with HELLP syndrome ,,3,"Hypertension may be diagnosed for the first time during pregnancy. Gestational hypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP)  140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP)  90 mm Hg on at least two occasions during a pregnancy. In this condition, the blood pressure returns to normal within 6 weeks after delivery. The presence of hypertension and proteinuria ( 300 mg/24 hours) indicates preeclampsia. Criteria for severe preeclampsia include an SBP 160 mm Hg or a DBP 110 mm Hg; proteinuria 5 g/224 hrs; oliguria; cerebral or visual symptoms; pulmonary edema; epigastric or right upper quadrant abdominal pain; impaired liver function; thrombocytopenia; and intrauterine growth retardation. The HELLP syndrome consists of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and thrombocytopenia. Eclampsia is the new occurrence of seizures in women with preeclampsia. Edema is no longer part of the diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia. Prehypertension is defined as an SBP of 130-140 mm Hg or a DBP of 80-90 mm Hg.  ",,
3053,2,OBGYN,A 39-year-old female presents for emergency contraceptive advice after having unprotected intercourse last night. She has had two previous normal deliveries and 6 months had a lower leg deep venous thrombosis.Which one of the following would be appropriate advice for this patient? ,If hormonal contraceptives are prescribed there is an increased risk of adverse fetal development ,High-dose estrogen-only (ethinyl estradiol) contraceptives given for 2 days are as effective as estrogen/progestin combinations ,A copper IUD inserted within 5 days of intercourse would be comparable to hormonal methods in terms of pregnancy prevention ,Previous venous thrombosis is an absolute contraindication to the use of emergency hormonal contraception ,Contraception is unlikely to be effective at this point ,,3,"Postcoital insertion of IUDs is highly effective and one of the most effective methods of emergency contraception if placed within 5 days after unprotected intercourse. Hormonal emergency contraception has no known medical contraindication. Likewise, no risk to a fetus or any adverse pregnancy outcome has ever been shown to result from the inadvertent use of postcoital contraceptives. High-dose estrogens for 5 days was one of the earliest methods of emergency contraception, but because of severe side effects is seldom used anymore. Emergency contraception is beneficial if used within 72 hours of intercourse in the case of hormonal therapy, and within 5 days in the case of the copper IUD. ",,
3054,2,OBGYN,Which one of the following vaccines is safe to give during pregnancy? ,Varicella ,Influenza ,Rubella ,Pneumococcal vaccine ,,,2,Influenza vaccine should be given to all pregnant women who will be in the second or third trimester during the influenza season. High-risk patients should be vaccinated regardless of the trimester. The vaccine is a killed virus preparation and its safety in pregnancy is well-established. Rubella and varicella vaccines contain live attenuated virus and are associated with adverse effects on the fetus. The safety of the pneumococcal vaccine in pregnancy has not been evaluated. ,,
3055,2,OBGYN,It would be appropriate to empirically treat asymptomatic bacteriuria in which one of the following patients? ,A 4-year-old female ,A 30-year-old gravida 2 para 1 in the first trimester ,A 40-year-old paraplegic with a neurogenic bladder ,A 95-year-old male ,A 95-year-old female ,,2,"Current guidelines strongly recommends that all pregnant women be screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria with a urine culture at 12-16 weeks gestation. (Recommendation Level A). The treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy reduces symptomatic urinary tract infections, pyelonephritis, low birth weight, and preterm delivery.These guidelines also recommend against the routine screening of men and nonpregnant women for asymptomatic bateriuria. (Recommendation level D). No benefit has been shown and there are potential harms associated with the overuse of antibiotics to treat asymptomatic patients with positive urine culture results.Studies have not demonstrated that either age or underlying medical condition (other than pregnancy) are indications for treating asymptomatic bacteriuria.

3056,2,OBGYN,A 39-year-old female with no past history of abnormal Papnicolaou (Pap) test receives a report indicating the presence of atypical glandular cells. Appropriate management would include ,"HPV DNA testing, and if negative, a repeat Pap test in 4-6 months ",Colposcopy with endocervical sampling and an endometrial biopsy ,An endometrial biopsy ,Referral for dilatation and curettage ,,,2,"Atypical glandular cells (AGC) on a Papanicolaou (Pap) test refers to tissue of endocervical or endometrial origin and not the typical squamous cells of the ectocervix. A Pap test demonstrating AGC is an indication for colposcopy with endometrial sampling. If the patient is over 35 years of age, when the risk of endometrial adenocarcinoma increases, an endometrial biopsy is also mandatory. AGC has not been associated with HPV infection. ",,
3057,2,OBGYN,A 24-year-old primiparous female at 8 weeks gestation presents to your office for her initial prenatal visit. She has no identifiable risks for the pregnancy. You counsel her regarding her lifestyle choices modifications for healthy pregnancy.Which one of the following would be appropriate advice? ,Abstain from sexual intercourse in the last trimester ,Avoid aspartame and sucralose in the first trimester ,Avoid intercontinental air travel after the first trimester ,Consume 1000-1300 mg of calcium daily ,Consume 4-5 servings of fish such as swordfish or mackerel per week ,,4,"The recommended intake of calcium during pregnancy is 1000-1300 mg daily. There are many concerns about toxic exposures during pregnancy, some of them based on evidence and some not. Air travel is discouraged in the 4 weeks prior to a patient's due date, but no recommendations restrict intercontinental flights for the entire pregnancy. Sexual intercourse is deemed safe during pregnancy (assuming a normal pregnancy). Aspartame and sucralose are also generally considered safe. Exposure to high levels of mercury in fish can lead to neurologic abnormalities in women and their infants. Therefore, pregnant women should avoid shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tuna steak, and limit intake of other fish (including canned tuna) to 12 oz (2-3 meals) per week. ",,
3058,2,OBGYN,A 25-year-old female at 30 weeks gestation has a blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg (baseline 135/85 mm Hg) and urine positive for 1+ protein. This patient should be evaluated with a ,Serum uric acid level ,A 24-hour urine protein level ,Calcium level ,Magnesium level ,,,2,"This patient may have preeclampsia. The current diagnostic criteria require a blood pressure 140/90 on repeated measurements and proteinuria >300 mg/24 hr, which usually corresponds to a urine protein of 1+ or greater on a urine dipstick test. A 24-hour urine collection is the preferred means of making the diagnosis, along with serial blood pressure measurements. Previous guidelines include edema in the diagnostic criteria, and the elevated blood pressure criteria could be met with an elevation of 30 mm Hg systolic or 15 mm Hg diastolic above the baseline prepregnancy blood pressure. Elevated serum uric acid is commonly seen in preeclampsia but lacks sensitivity and specificity in making this diagnosis. Calcium levels and magnesium levels are not diagnostic. Once the diagnosis of preeclampsia is made there are several laboratory tests that are recommended weekly: hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, serum creatinine, serum transaminases, serum  lactic dehydrogenase, serum albumin, coagulation profiles, and peripheral blood smears. In addition, repeat 24-hour urine collections are advised, since rising 24-hour urine protein levels are worrisome. Urine protein excretion >5000 mg/24 hr is by itself diagnostic of severe preclampsia. ",,
3060,2,OBGYN,A 52-year-old recently menopausal female has developed hot flashes that she describes as severe. She currently takes no prescribed or over-the-counter medications and declines estrogen replacement therapy.Which one of the following would be most effective for relieving this patient's symptoms? ,Fluoxetine (Prozac) ,Black cohosh ,Red clover ,Soy protein ,Vitamin E ,,1,"Hot flashes have been shown to be most effectively treated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT). However, given the concerns regarding HRT, alternative strategies for managing hot flashes have been evaluated. Placebo-controlled trials have shown that vitamin E, soy protein, red clover, and black cohosh are not better or only slightly better than placebo in reducing hot flashes. SSRIs have been shown to be significantly more effective than placebo in relieving this symptom. Methyldopa has shown some benefit compared to placebo, but causes frequent side effects. ",,
3061,2,OBGYN,"A 20-year-old female college tennis player presents with painful anterior lower leg lesions. You note several 2- to 3-cm wide, tender, warm lesions over both shins. The patient denies specific trauma or increased exercise.The most significant etiology to be considered in this case is ",Papular urticaria ,Early rheumatoid arthritis ,Shin splints ,Superficial thrombophlebitis ,Oral contraceptive use ,,5,"This patient has typical erythema nodosum, likely related to oral contraceptive use. Careful evaluation of the skin lesions would exclude early rheumatoid arthritis, shin splints, and superficial thrombophlebitis. Papular urticaria, a hypersensitivity reaction to common insect bites such as fleas, mosquitos, bedbugs and other insects, is another possibility to consider, although these lesions are generally smaller, and papular or papulovesicular in appearance.

3062,2,OBGYN,A previously low-risk primigravida is found to have a uterine measurement of 33 cm at her 37-week visit. On pelvic examination there is no evidence of leaking fluid. A sonogram shows borderline oligohydramnios with an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 6.5. No anomalies are evident on the sonogram and the estimated fetal weight is at the 50th percentile for gestational age. A nonstress test is reactive.Which one of the following would be most appropriate at this point? ,Cesarean delivery ,Induction of labor ,Amniocentesis and induction of labor if fetal lung maturity is confirmed ,Repeat nonstress testing and AFI measurement in a few days ,,,4,"Borderline oligohydramnios, defined as an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 5.0-8.0, has not been associated with poor outcomes except when a fetal anomaly or growth restriction is present. After testing for normal growth and fetal well-being, regular follow-up is adequate. Even in the presence of true isolated oligohydramnios (AFI 5), the patient can be followed if the hydration raises the AFI above 5, as long as intrauterine growth retardation and anomalies are not present. At 41 weeks gestation and beyond, oligohydramnios is an indication for induction of labor. ",,
3063,2,OBGYN,"An 18 year old gravida 1 para 0 at 40 5/7 weeks gestation presents stating that she thinks her water broke 12h ago. A sterile speculum examination confirms rupture of the membranes. There are no signs of active labor. The patient is afebrile, her uterus is nontender, and fetal heart tones are reassuring. The remainder of the prenatal history is unremarkable. A group B Streptococcus culture obtained 4 weeks ago was negative. The patient has no known drug allergies.In addition to induction of labor, which one of the following is the most appropriate management for this patient? ",No antibiotic prophylaxis ,"Ampicillin, 2 g intravenously initially, then 1 g intravenously every 4 hours until delivery ","Cefazolin (Ancef), 2 g intravenously initially, then 1 g intravenously every 8 hours until delivery ","Clindamycin (Cleocin), 900 mg intravenously every 8 hours until delivery ","Vancomycin (Vancocin), 1 g intravenously every 12 hours until delivery ",,1,"According to current guidelines, women with negative vaginal and rectal group B Streptococcus screening within 5 weeks of delivery do not require intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis. This holds even if certain obstetric risk factors develop (delivery at 37 weeks gestation, duration of membrane rupture 18 hours, or temperature 100.4F or 38C). In patients requiring intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, penicillin is the first-line agent, with ampicillin as an acceptable alternative. For women who have a known penicillin allergy, cefazolin should be used if the patient is not at high risk for anaphylaxis. If the patient is at high risk for anaphylaxis, clindamycin is an acceptable alternative if prior cultures have shown susceptibility. If the susceptibility is unknown, vancomycin should be used. ",,

Placental blood flow may be markedly reduced and extreme fetal distress and in utero death may occur. The drugs are not recommended for use, even short-term use, during pregnancy. Methyldopa, nifedipine and labetalol all are used for the treatment of hypertension in pregnancy. ",,
3065,2,OBGYN,"A 24-year-old female presents with a complaint of mild fullness in the neck. A review of systems is negative, except for some poor sleep related to the care of her 4-month-old infant, and mild palpitations at times when she is tired. Her pregnancy was uneventful, and breastfeeding is going well. Findings on examination are normal except for enlargement of the thyroid. Her TSH level is 0.1 &mu;U/mL (N 0.3-5.0).Which one of the following would be most appropriate at this point? ",Reassure the patient that this is a common event that requires no treatment unless significant symptoms develop ,Prescribe propranolol (Inderal) and have the patient stop breastfeeding ,"Advise the patient to stop breastfeeding, start low-dose propylthiouracil, and adjust on a biweekly basis until the TSH has returned to normal ","Arrange for a radioactive iodine uptake scan, and if low start levothyroxine (Synthroid), 0.05 mg/day, and recheck the TSH level in 6 weeks ",,,1,"Postpartum thyroiditis is a common condition, occurring after 3%-16% of pregnancies. It is thought to be a variation of Hashimoto's disease and can present in several ways. It can cause hyperthyroidism, beginning 1-4 months after delivery and lasting for 2-8 weeks. Thyroid function then either returns to normal or the patient develops transient or permanent hypothyroidism. Another possible manifestation is hypothyroidism beginning 2-6 months after delivery, which again can either be transient or become permanent. A third possibility is that the patient can develop a euthyroid goiter.As in this case, the symptoms are usually mild, and can be confused with the typical feelings of a new mother. Since the symptoms are mild and the hyperthyroid stage is brief, treatment is not necessary in the majority of cases. The hyperthyroid symptoms should be explained to the patient, and she should also be made aware of the symptoms of hypothyroidism, since it is a common development after the hyperthyroid stage has passed and may be permanent. Breastfeeding was going well in this patient, and should be continued. Propranolol is not needed unless the palpitations worsen. Propylthiouracil is used for Graves' disease, to counteract overproduction of thyroid hormone. Withpostpartum thyroiditis, as with other types of thyroiditis, thyroid hormone is released from the gland as a result of autoimmune injury, but production of thyroid hormone is actually low. Propylthiouracil has no place in the treatment of thyroiditis.Radioactive thyroid scanning is not necessary unless symptoms are significant and are not resolving, in which case Graves' disease masquerading as thyroiditis must be ruled out. Thyroiditis would cause low uptake, but this has no bearing as to whether thyroid hormone needs to be given. Thyroid hormone is used in postpartum thyroiditis if the person is found to be hypothyroid (with high levels of TSH), with symptoms significant enough to require treatment. Treatment would be continued for 1-2 months and then stopped, and the TSH level rechecked 1 month later to see if the hypothyroid condition has resolved. ",,
3066,6,Surgery,"A 25-year-old female distance runner has had left Achilles pain with running for the past 3 months, progressing to pain at rest. She has tried NSAIDs and stretching with no improvement in symptoms.Which one of the following should be avoided at this point? ",Surgery ,Use of a heel lift ,Deep friction massage ,Eccentric strength training ,,,1,"Achilles tendinopathy is a common problem in runners. NSAIDs often do not work because of the lack of inflammation generally associated with this problem. Initially, conservative therapy is recommended, including cryotherapy, a heel lift, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, deep friction massage, and eccentric strength training. If the patient fails 3-6 months of conservative therapy, surgery could be effective. This would not be recommended in the short term due to associated risks. ",,

3068,6,Surgery,"A 45-year-old female presents with a 1-day history of left leg swelling. She notes that this has never happened to her before, and she denies any trauma to the leg. She underwent an appendectomy 10 weeks ago, and is otherwise healthy. A physical examination is normal except for 2+ pitting edema of the entire left leg.The most appropriate next step would be ",Ultrasonography of the left leg ,Pelvic ultrasonography ,Echocardiography ,A trial of diuretics ,Compression and elevation of the left leg ,,1,"No single clinical finding can be used to accurately diagnose deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Patients can be classified into low, moderate, or high-risk categories  using a variety of risk factors. These include active cancer, paralysis, immobilization, local tenderness, swelling of the entire leg, a calf circumference 3 cm larger than that of the asymptomatic side, pitting edema, collateral superficial veins, a history of recent surgery, and previous DVT. The presence of three or more risk factors (in this case, swelling of the entire leg, pitting edema, and a history of recent surgery) places the patient into a high-risk category, which is an indication for ultrasonography. Observation only, or a trial of diuretics, would put the patient at risk of dying from an undiagnosed pulmonary embolus. Pelvic ultrasonography and echocardiography are unlikely to reveal the source of the problem.  ",,

If the patient has no vomiting or it resolves with medication, then outpatient treatment with oral hydration and pain medication is appropriate. Stones that are less than 5 mm in diameter will pass spontaneously 90% of the time. Stones over 8 mm will most likely require surgical intervention. A 5-mm stone is likely to pass with medical management; however, close follow-up is recommended to document spontaneous passage of the stone. It is appropriate to wait up to 2 weeks for the stone to pass. If the stone does not pass in 2 weeks, urologic referral is recommended. ",,

Of the 15% who present with syncope, 50% die within 3 years unless the valve is replaced. And of the 50% of aortic stenosis patients who present with congestive heart failure, 50% die within 2 years without valve replacement. The annual risk for sudden death in patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis ranges from 10% with angina patients to 15% in patients with syncope and 25% in patients with congestive heart failure.Pernicious anemia is a treatable disease not associated with aortic stenosis.

3078,6,Surgery,Which one of the following is most typical of acute Achilles tendon rupture? ,A history of a gradual onset of heel pain ,"Increased calf pressure, as measured with a blood pressure cuff, on dorsiflexion of the affected foot ",The inability to dorsiflex the affected foot,The inability to do a single-leg toe raise on the affected side , &ldquo;Hyperplantarflexion&rdquo; sign,,4,"Acute Achilles tendon rupture usually presents as a sudden sensation of being kicked in the posterior heel region. Because other muscle functions of the lower extremity are preserved, there may be some active range of motion. However, the patient will not be able to do a single-leg toe raise on the affected side. Dorseiflexion of the affected foot with a blood pressure cuff inflated around the calf to 100 mm Hg will normally cause an increase to 140 mm Hg. In patients with Achilles tendon rupture this rise does not occur. There is also a loss of plantar flexion power in the affected foot.Clinical tests:&ldquo;Hyperdorsiflexion&rdquo; sign &ndash; With the patient prone and knees flexed to 90&ordm;, maximal passive dorsiflexion of both feet may reveal excessive dorsiflexion of the affected leg.Thompson test &ndash; With the patient prone, squeezing the calf of the extended leg may demonstrate no passive plantar flexion of the foot if its Achilles tendon is ruptured.O'Brien needle test &ndash; Insert a needle 10 cm proximal to the calcaneal insertion of the Achilles tendon. With passive dorsiflexion of the foot, the hub of the needle will tilt rostrally when the Achilles tendon is intact.8 ",,
3079,6,Surgery,A 79-year-old white male presents with a 4-hour history of acute abdominal pain. He indicates that the pain is severe and intermittently screams with discomfort. The abdomen is soft with minimal diffuse tenderness. There is no abdominal guarding or localized tenderness. Bowel sounds are hypoactive and vital signs are unremarkable. There is no psychiatric history or history of prior abdominal surgery.Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ,Mesenteric ischemia ,Appendicitis ,Cholecystitis ,Diverticulitis ,Perforated peptic ulcer ,,1,"Mesenteric ischemia is a manifestation of atherosclerotic disease. The elderly and those with vascular disease are at risk. The pain is normally disproportionate severe when compared to physical findings, which are often minimal.Perforated peptic ulcers often present with abdominal guarding, if not the characteristic board-like rigidity. Appendicitis, cholecystitis, and diverticulitis typically present with abdominal tenderness or guarding in the characteristic locations. Findings may be more subtle in the elderly, as the apparent pain is usually proportionately less; the elderly tend to have a higher pain tolerance than younger patients. ",,
3080,6,Surgery,"A 40-year-old male comes to the urgent care center with severe pain in his right knee. The pain began suddenly when he pivoted on the knee while playing touch football at a family Thanksgiving gathering.You perform the following: the knee is placed in 30&deg; of flexion, with the patient lying supine. Using one hand on the anterior aspect of the distal femur and a second hand behind the proximal tibia, you attempt to displace the tibia forward from the femur. You remark about 1cm of tibial excursion. This is best described as: ",A positive Lachman test ,A positive anterior drawer test ,Joint line tenderness ,The inability to fully extend the knee ,The inability to walk without a limp on the affected leg ,,1,"A positive Lachman test is strong evidence of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear. Although widely used, the anterior drawer test is the least helpful maneuver for diagnosing an ACL tear. Joint line tenderness is not very helpful for either confirming or ruling out meniscal injury. The five criteria in the Ottawa Knee Rule include &ldquo;inability to flex (not extend) the knee to 90&#730;&rdquo; and &ldquo;inability to bear weight for four steps both immediately and in the examination room regardless of limping&rdquo;.How to perform Lachman test:-Stand next to the supine patient, on the side of the exam table.-Grasp the lateral thigh just above the knee with your upper (contralateral) hand. -Hold the tibia medially with your lower (ipsalateral) hand.-Put your lower thumb on the joint line. -Steady the leg with your upper hand and gently lift it, asking the patient to keep the foot on the table, such that the knee flexes to 30 degrees.-Ask the patient to relax.-Gently yet suddenly apply a juddering force to the tibia in an attempt to subluxate it forward. -Assess in your mind the extent of excursion and the 'quality' of the end pointThe normal response: There should be a firm restraint to anterior translation. The tibia should not move forward much (the same amount as found on the other side) and it should come to a strong stop, the so-called &quot;good end point&quot; as the ACL reaches its maximum length Again, this end point on the injured leg should be comparable to the normal side.What it means if not normal --&gt; ACL deficiency is suggested.Grades of laxity defined by amount of anterior tibial translation relative to contralateral knee:Grade I: 1-5mmGrade II: 6-10mmGrade III: &gt;10mm ",,
3081,6,Surgery,A 21-year-old female marathon runner presents to your office complaining of persistent shin splints. She reports that she has had to decrease her running because of this problem. On examination you note an area of localized tenderness over the distal medial tibia a few centimeters above the ankle.Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ,Osgood-Schlatter disease ,Tibialis posterior tendinitis ,Tibial stress fracture ,Pes anserine tendinitis ,,,3,"Tibial stress fracture may present similarly to shin splints but tend to be persistent, and pain occurs with increasingly less activity. Athletes engaged in high-level repetitive training are at risk. Also at risk are patients with osteopenia, which may result from amenorrhea secondary to overtraining. Point tenderness helps differentiate tibial stress fractures from shin splints. Osgood-Schlatter disease and pes anserine tendinitis present as more proximal pain in the knee area. Tibialis posterior tendinitis causes pain that extends to the medial malleolus. ",,

Tendon rupture is a potential side effect of quinolone therapy. ",,
3083,6,Surgery,A 25-year-old male presents with a history of a forceful blow to the tip of the extended middle finger of his right hand during a neighborhood volleyball game last evening. You diagnose mallet finger. Which one of the following findings would lead you to consider referring this patient for surgical consultation? ,Pain in the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint ,Lack of full passive extension of the DIP joint ,The inability to actively extend the DIP joint ,A flexion deformity ,Radiographic evidence of an avulsion fracture involving 10% of the joint space ,,2,"Injury to the extensor tendon at the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, also known as mallet finger, is the most common closed tendon injury of the finger. Mallet finger is usually caused by an object (e.g., a ball) striking the finger, forcefully flexing an extended DIP. The extensor tendon may be stretched, partially torn, completely ruptured, or separated by a distal phalanx avulsion fracture. Patients with mallet finger present with pain at the dorsal DIP joint, the inability to actively extend the joint, and often a characteristic flexion deformity. It is important to isolate the DIP joint during the evaluation to ensure extension from the extensor tendon and not the central slip. The absence of full passive extension may indicate bony or soft-tissue entrapment requiring surgical intervention.Bony avulsion fractures are present in one-third of patients with mallet finger. Conservative treatment is successful for up to 3 months, even with delayed presentation. Referral criteria include bony avulsions involving over 30% of the joint space or the inability to achieve full passive extension. ",,
3084,6,Surgery,"A 45-year-old white male has a 3-week history of inferior heel pain in his right foot of 3 weeks' duration. It has been partially relieved by NSAIDs. The patient, who works as a department store salesperson, describes the pain as throbbing, especially with the first few steps in the morning. It is made worse by walking up stairs. He has no other known medical problems.On physical examination, the patient is 178 cm (70 in) tall and weighs 128 kg (282 lb). The left foot is normal and the right foot is tender around the medial calcaneal tuberosity at the plantar aponeurosis.Which one of the following diagnoses is most consistent with this presentation? ",Tarsal tunnel syndrome ,Plantar fasciitis ,Achilles tendinitis ,Calcaneal epiphysitis (Sever's disease) ,Subtalar arthritis ,,2,"This case is typical of plantar fasciitis. This condition is more likely to occur in persons who are obese and spend the day on their feet. It typically presents with inferior heel pain on weight bearing, and the pain often persists for months or even years. Pain associated with plantar fasciitis may be throbbing, searing, or piercing, especially with the first few steps in the morning or after periods of inactivity. The discomfort often improves after further ambulation but worsens with continued activity. Walking barefoot, on toes, or up stairs may exacerbate the pain. The patient usually has tenderness around the medial calcaneal tuberosity at the plantar aponeurosis. Although treatment usually includes NSAIDs, no studies have specifically examined the effectiveness of this treatment alone. Tarsal tunnel syndrome presents with pain, as well as a burning sensation and tingling on the sole of the foot. Achilles tendinitis presents with retrocalcaneal pain, Sever's disease presents as heel pain in adolescents, and subtalar arthritis presents with supracalcaneal pain. ",,
3085,6,Surgery,"A 42-year-old nurse presents with pain in her right foot. Six hours ago, she stepped in a hole and fell, twisting her foot while her weight as on it. She is unable to bear weight due to the pain. On examination, there is moderate swelling and tenderness to palpation over the dorsum of the midfoot.The most likely diagnosis is ",Distal third metatarsal fractures ,Fracture of the talus ,Middle cuneiform fracture ,Lisfranc fracture/dislocation ,Rupture of the anterior tibial tendon ,,4,"A careful history, physical examination, and diagnostic studies usually lead to appropriate treatment of foot and ankle injuries. However, Lisfranc fracture/dislocation can be difficult to detect both clinically and radiographically. To help ensure that a Lisfranc injury is not missed, and foot with pain and swelling resulting from trauma must be examined radiographically. A fracture of the base of a metatarsal bone indicates a possible Lisfranc injury. Furthermore, if soft-tissue edema persists after an injury to the foot, a Lisfranc injury should be ruled out.Of the other conditions, only the cuneiform fractures affect the midfoot; these are extremely uncommon, and usually result from a direct blow to the foot rather than the twisting injury described in this case.

3086,6,Surgery,"A 14-year-old male presents for a routine physical examination. During a genital examination, you note a mass over the left testicle. This mass feels like a bag of worms, but resolves when you examine the patient in the supine position.The most appropriate course of care would be ",Observation ,Testicular volume evaluation ,Immediate referral for surgical correction ,Hormonal therapy ,Referral to an infertility specialist when indicated ,,2,"This patient has a varicocele, which is not a normal variant but rather a collection of dilated and tortuous veins in the pampiniform plexus around the spermatic cord. The cause is not fully understood, but it has been hypothesized that varicoceles result from increased venous pressure and incompetent valves. Approximately 85%-95% occur on the left side, and if they are found on the right side or occur bilaterally, surgical intervention is recommended. Also, if the varicocele is large or painful, has an acute onset, or does not resolve in the supine position, a surgical referral should be made. Infertility is a problem for only 10%-15% of patients with varicoceles, and hormonal therapy is not recommended. Testicular volumes should be measured, and if the affected testicle has a volume 2 mL less than the normal testicle, referral is prudent. ",,

He does not recall any acute injury, but he is a recreational runner and admits to increasing his distance around the time the symptoms began. Findings on examination are consistent with a fracture of the neck of the second metatarsal.Which one of the following would be most appropriate? ","Cast immobilization with no weight bearing for 2 weeks, followed by partial weight bearing and cast removal after callus formation is evidence ",A splint and no weight bearing for 4 weeks until callus formation is evident ,"Partial weight bearing as tolerated, with NSAIDs to relieve inflammation and pain ","Avoiding activities that cause pain, with resumption of more strenuous activities in 4-8 weeks as tolerated ",,,4,"This patient has a classic stress fracture of the second metatarsal. This results from repetitive stress to the forefoot, in his case from increasing his running distance. Stress fracture usually begin as a gradual onset of pain in the forefoot, initially when active, but later also at rest. Radiographs may not be positive for 2-6 weeks after the onset of symptoms. The neck of the second metatarsal is most commonly involved.Unlike acute fractures, a stress fracture does not require casting. It can be managed by limiting the stresses that cause it to happen, and which continue to cause discomfort. Activity can be continued as long as it does not cause discomfort. Limiting analgesic use allows the patient to know when he is overdoing it. NSAIDs may slow the healing process and most specialists recommend they not be used in this situation. ",,
3089,6,Surgery,A 70-year-old male with progressive hip osteoarthritis plans to undergo elective hip replacement as recommended by his orthopedic surgeon. He recently suffered an acute myocardial infarction (MI) and wishes to minimize his chances of reinfarction.Assuming his hip symptoms are not debilitating. how long after his MI would you advise him to wait before having this elective operation performed? ,1 month ,3 months ,6 months ,9 months ,12 months ,,3,Two studies have evaluated the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) after general anesthesia in patients with a history of previous MI. A reinfarction rate of 27%-37% occurred in patients who underwent surgery within 3 months of infarction. The reinfarction rate was 11%-16% in patients who underwent surgery 3-6 months after the MI. The reinfarction rate remained stable (5%) for patients who underwent surgery more than 6 months after MI. ,,
3090,6,Surgery,"A 55-year-old male complains of gradually increasing lower abdominal pain of 3 days' duration. His appetite has decreased and he has passed a single loose stool that was nonbloody. A physical examination is significant for sharp pain in the lower left quadrant with a minimal amount of rebound tenderness. His temperature is 37.4&#730;C (99.3&#730;F) and his WBC count is 12,800/mm3 (N 5500-10,500). A urinalysis is normal, as is an upright abdominal radiograph.Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ",Acute appendicitis ,Bacterial enterocolitis ,Diverticulitis ,Meckel's diverticulum ,Perforated viscus ,,3,"Colonic diverticuli are most commonly seen in the descending and sigmoid colon in patients who are middle-aged and older. Inflammation of a diverticulum (i.e., diverticulum) often presents with some combination of peritoneal signs, fever, anorexia, and leukocytosis. This presentation is similar to that of acute appendicitis, which occurs in the right lower quadrant with rare exceptions. Meckel's diverticulum is another possible cause of this patient's presentation, but is a rare occurrence. Perforated viscus is unlikely apart from a primary etiology such as diverticulitis, and free air in the abdomen would be expected on an upright abdominal radiograph. Bacterial enterocolitis is unlikely without the presence of diarrhea or blood stools. A patient in this condition may benefit from a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to confirm the presence of diverticulitis and to rule out other, less common etiologies. Some cases of diverticulitis will present too early to be seen on CT. In such cases,. empiric treatment with antibiotics would be appropriate. ",,

Which one of the following would be least appropriate at this point? ",Left carotid endarterectomy ,Echocardiography ,Lowering the patient's LDL level ,Prescribing aspirin , Cardiac rhythm monitoring,,1,"This patient's symptoms suggest a right hemispheric lesion; therefore, the left carotid stenosis should be considered an asymptomatic lesion not requiring surgery (endarterectomy). Other studies should be performed to find the cause of this patient's reversible ischemic neurologic deficit (RIND) or transient ischemic attack (TIA), including echocardiography, cardiac rhythm monitoring, and additional laboratory studies. Risk factors should be addressed, including discontinuing tobacco, treating hypertension, and lowering the LDL level to below 100 mg/dL. Treatment would include antiplatelet therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel, ticlopidine, or aspirin with dipyridamole. ",,
3092,6,Surgery,"An 80-year-old male had knee replacement surgery this morning. You are called by the nursing staff late at night because he had climbed out of bed and was found on the floor by a nurse.

A retired banker, he now volunteers as a financial manager for several local charities. He had a negative stress test before the elective surgery. The operation was done under combined general and epidural anesthesia, and postoperative pain has been treated with morphine via patient-controlled analgesia.Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ",Psychotic depression ,Delirium ,Stroke ,Morphine overdose ,Meningitis ,,2,"This patient has postoperative delirium, a condition that usually has multiple contributing factors. In this case these could include: age, general anesthesia, and perhaps prolonged tourniquet time. The patient has a disturbance of perception, loss of judgment, and change in mood.Although the patient's mood is depressed at present, the problem is labile and acute in nature, rather than being chronic like major depression. A patient may become delirious with a stroke, but the picture is usually dominated by deficits of function. Morphine contributes to delirium, but overdose is another syndrome entirely, presenting with hypotension, respiratory depression, and somnolence.The use of epidural anesthesia may raise the risk of meningitis, but this is very rare, and is associated with prolonged use of an epidural catheter. Meningitis may produce delirium, but would normally cause signs of sepsis, headache, and neck stiffness.  ",,

The patient consults you regarding the preoperative and postoperative management of his anticoagulation.You plan to stop his regular daily warfarin dose 3-4 days prior to his scheduled operation and restart it the day after. Which one of the following would be most appropriate during the 4-5 days he is not taking his regular warfarin? ",No additional medication ,"Aspirin, 81-325 mg/day orally ",Half of his usual daily warfarin dose ,Low-molecular-weight heparin injections once or twice a day ,Admission to the hospital for treatment with intravenous heparin ,,1,"Guidelines have been established for the management of anticoagulation during invasive procedures. Patients with lone atrial fibrillation without previous thromboembolic events are at low risk (1% annualized thrombotic risk) for a thrombotic event in the absence of anticoagulation. They can be safely managed with cessation of warfarin 3-4 days preoperatively, and resumption of warfarin postoperatively when the surgeon indicates it is safe to do so.If the operative procedure is associated with a high risk of thrombosis, then prophylactic, rather than therapeutic, doses of unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin can be used as a postoperative bridge to restarting warfarin.Patients at high risk for a thrombotic event in the absence of anticoagulation, such as those with prosthetic heart valves, should be managed by stopping warfarin 3-4 days preoperatively, beginning fully therapeutic doses of low-molecular-weight heparin or intravenous unfractionated heparin when the INR decreases below the therapeutic range, stopping therapy briefly for surgery, and then resuming the heparin bridge postoperatively until warfarin is resumed. Dental procedures do not generally require interruption of anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. ",,

He states that the pain is worse during walking and standing and is alleviated by sitting.This patient is most likely suffering from ",Spondylolisthesis ,Ankylosing spondylitis ,Parasponal muscule strain ,Lumbar disc herniation ,Spinal stenosis ,,5,"The differential diagnosis of lower back pain (LBP) for patients more than 50 years of age is substantially different from the most likely etiologies of LBP in younger patients. The history, rather than radiologic or laboratory evaluation, is usually the key to diagnosis. This elderly patient's complaints fit the classic example of LBP caused by spinal stenosis. If the pain improved with standing, disc herniation should be considered. In a much younger male patient, ankylosing spondylitis would be a rare but possible cause of the pain. Muscle strain is very common, but usually causes pain that remains localized to the lower back area.

The operation is uneventful, but 2 hours after the surgery he suddenly spikes a fever to 40.0&#730;C (104.0&#730;F). The patient's pulse rate is 110 beats/min and his blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg. He remains on the ventilator and does not awaken during the episode. The physical examination is otherwise unremarkable except for his surgical incisions. He has no history of recent infection prior to the surgery and his WBC count is not elevated. Apart from hypertension and coronary artery disease, his past medical and surgical histories are negative.The most likely explanation for this patient's fever is ",Transient bacteremia ,Aspiration pneumonia ,Urosepsis ,Malignant hyperthermia ,Post-pericardiotomy syndrome ,,4,"Malignant hyperthermia is an inherited myopathy in which abnormalities of skeletal-muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum cause an increase in intracellular calcium levels, resulting in sustained muscular contraction and a hypermetabolic state. This condition is most often triggered by inhalational anesthetics (e.g., halothane) or by succinylcholine, used for muscle paralysis. It results in a sudden rise in temperature, tachycardia, increased muscle tone, and eventual muscle rigidity. If unrecognized and untreated, there is a downward spiral with rhadbomyolysis, acidosis, renal failure, cardiovascular instability, and death. It usually presents in the operating room or the recovery room, and prompt recognition and treatment with dantrolene, along with cooling the patient, reduces morbidity and mortality risks.While urosepsis, pneumonia, and bacteremia are possible complications of the surgery, none of these is the most likely cause of fever in this scenario. Post-pericardiotomy syndrome (Dressler's syndrome) occurs at least 2 weeks postoperatively and is manifested by low-grade fever and chest pain. ",,
3096,5,Psychiatry,"A 28-year-old male comes to your office with concerns that he may have attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD). He says he was a bad student and was frequently told he was hyper as a child. His adult life is characterized by uncompleted projects and he has difficulty focusing on details of his work. He has had difficulty keeping jobs, and a career counselor suggested he talk with a doctor about the possibility of getting on Ritalin.Which one of the following is true in this situation? ",ADHD cannot be diagnosed because the patient is over 18 years of age ,He is unlikely to respond to stimulant medications because he is an adult ,The presence of symptoms since early childhood meets one of the criterion for the diagnosis of ADHD ,The criteria for diagnosing ADHD in adults are different than those for children ,The diagnosis of ADHD in adults is decreasing in frequency ,,3,"Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is becoming more widely recognized. Attention deficit is a genetic disorder that is present from birth, and should not be diagnosed in a person who has not had a history of symptoms since childhood. The criteria for diagnosing ADHD do not differ for children and adults, and there is no mention in the DSM-IV of age, except that there must have been some symptoms prior to age 7. Self-reporting of symptoms has been found to be very reliable in adults and is often required. The most commonly used category of medications for adult ADHD is stimulants. ",,
3097,5,Psychiatry,"Difficult patients include those who make repeated visits without apparent medical benefit, those who do not seem to want to get well, those who engage in power struggles, and those who focus on issues seemingly unrelated to medical care. Which one of the following strategies is recommended for managing such patients? ",Ignore the problem behavior ,Refer the patient to another physician ,Confront the patient directly about the negative behavior and the reality that there is nothing physically wrong ,Schedule regular visits at 2- to 3-week intervals ,Prescribe an SSRI ,,4,"Ignoring the problem or exporting it to another physician does not make the difficulty disappear. Accusing the patient of being problematic may provoke patient anger and counter-blaming. Telling the patient that there is nothing wrong or that there is nothing you can do for him or her may trigger persistent attempts to prove that a problem exists. Attempts to solve problems with psychopharmacology, unless carefully introduced and targeted to a specific diagnosis, may also prove problematic. One of the best suggestions for better management of these patients is to schedule regular follow-up visits at 2- to 3-week intervals, especially if high dependency needs are suspected.  ",,
3098,5,Psychiatry,Which one of the following is true regarding suicide? ,Adolescents are a low-risk group for suicide ,Two-thirds of suicide deaths occur on the first attempt ,Women have a higher rate of completed suicide than men ,Men attempt suicide more often than women ,"Among men, blacks have the highest suicide rate ",,2,"No evidence that has been found to demonstrate that screening for suicide risk reduces suicide attempts or mortality. There is limited evidence regarding the accuracy of screening tools to identify suicide risk in the primary care setting, including tools to identify those at high risk. In addition, there is insufficient evidence to show that treatment of those at high risk reduces suicide attempts or mortality. Two-third of suicide deaths occur on the first attempt, with higher completion rates in men than in women. Although men complete suicide more often than women, women attempt suicide more often than men. Almost 75% of completed suicides are by white males, who have a two-fold higher risk for suicide than black males. Adolescents and the elderly are high-risk groups for suicide. ",,
3099,5,Psychiatry,"A 22 year old male presents to the emergency department after taking an overdose of fluoxetine (Prozac). His symptoms include fever, tremor, diarrhea, shivering, and sweats. On examinagion the patient has a temperature of 38.3C (100.9F) is diaphoretic, and is hyperreflexic with inducible clonus.Which one of the following is recommended for treatment of this syndrome?",Propranolol,Bromocriptine,Dantrolene,Valproate,Cyproheptadine,,5,"There are many seratonergic agents that can cause serotonin syndrome, including SSRIs. The severity of the symptoms varies, and therapy should be adjusted accordingly. Mild cases, with hyperreflexia and tremor but no fever, can usually be managed with supportive care, discontinuation of the precipitating drugs, and benzodiazepines. Moderately ill patients should have all cardiorespiratory and thermal abnormalities aggressively corrected, and may benefit from a 5-HT2A antagonist such as cyproheptadine. Hyperthermic patients (temperature 41.1C) are severely ill and should receive all of these treatments, as well as immediate sedation, neuromuscular paralysis, and orotracheal intubation.Propranolol, a 5-HT1A antagonist with a long duration of action, may cause hypotension and shock in patients with autonomic instability. Furthermore, propranolol can eliminate tachycardia, which can be used to determine the duration and effectiveness of therapy. Bromocriptine and Dantrolene are not useful therapies; case reports citing their use probably involved a misdiagnosis of another condition as the serotonin syndrome. Bromocriptine has actually been implicated in the development of the serotonin syndrome, as has valproate. ",,
3100,5,Psychiatry,Postpartum depression may be distinguished from the baby blues by which one of the following characteristics? ,Episodes of crying ,Feelings of sadness ,Irritability ,Anxiety ,Duration of symptoms ,,5,"Crying, sadness, and confusion are common to both postpartum depression and baby blues. Baby blues usually lasts for 1-2 weeks post partum, not long enough for antidepressants to work. Postpartum depression lasts for months, and may not be evident for up to a month after delivery. ",,

You confirm that she is pregnant, at 6 weeks gestation.She has a several-year history of moderate to severe depression which is well controlled with fluoxetine (Prozac), and is concerned about the drug's effect on her pregnancy. You advise her that she should ",Continue fluoxetine ,Discontinue fluoxetine and substitute a tricyclic antidepressant ,Discontinue fluoxetine and substitute valproic acid (Depakene) ,Discontinue fluoxetine and substitute lithium ,Add bupropion (Wellbutrin) to the fluoxetine ,,1,"Fluoxetine has been shown to be safe and effective throughout pregnancy. Tricyclic antidepressants are not safer. Valproic acid and lithium can cause significant teratogenic effects in the first trimester. There is limited data on bupropion, and its use is therefore not recommended during pregnancy. ",,

",,
3103,5,Psychiatry,Which one of the following is considered both an effective and safe treatment for seasonal affective disorder? ,Melatonin ,Fluticasone (Flonase) ,Phototherapy ,Lithium ,Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) ,,3,"Seasonal affective disorder is defined as recurrent depressive episodes that occur during the autumn and winter, with cessation of symptoms during spring and summer. Typical symptoms include sleep disturbance, loss of interest in daily activities, and decreased libido. It is more common in North America than in Europe. Both SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants are effective; however, phototherapy, with exposure of the eyes, not the skin, it is also effective and has less potential for side effects. Melatonin may induce symptoms of winter depression in patients successfully treated with phototherapy. Lithium is primarily used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, and has the potential for significant side effects. Electroconvulsant therapy is used to treat major depression, often with psychotic features. Fluticasone is used in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. ",,
3104,5,Psychiatry,Which one of the following medications is associated with the highest risk for falls in elderly patients? ,Acetaminophen,Atorvastatin (Lipitor) ,Sertraline (Zoloft) ,Pseudoephedrine ,Fludrocortisone (Florinef) ,,3,"Most falls result from interactions between predisposing factors and precipitating factors in a person's environment. The use of four or more prescription medications increases fall risk, as does the use of certain individual classes of medications, including SSRIs (such as sertraline), tricyclic antidepressants, neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, and class IA antiarrhythmic agents.The other agents listed have not been associated with falls in the elderly. Fludrocortisone causes salt and water retention and may reduce the risk of orthostatic hypotension, a cause of falls in the elderly. Pseudoephedrine stimulates adrenergic receptors and tends to raise blood pressure as well. Statin drugs have no known association with falls. ",,
3105,5,Psychiatry,"A 25-year-old male presents to your clinic concerned that he may have cancer. He has noted palpitations, abdominal cramps, and weight loss over the past 3 months. He has begun to avoid eating breakfast because his symptoms seem to occur only in the morning as he is driving to work. He admits to some stressors at work, mainly because he cannot concentrate well. He also is having problems with his marriage. He blames this on difficulty adjusting since returning 6 months ago from military service in Iraq. He also wonders if he could have picked up a parasite or been exposed to chemicals during patrols in his armored vehicle.He notes problems with sleep, night sweats, and daytime irritability. He has a family history of hyperthyroidism, depression, and irritable bowel syndrome. A physical examination is normal.The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is ",Hyperthyroidism ,Posttraumatic stress disorder ,Depression ,Giardia infection ,Irritable bowel syndrome ,,2,"Many veterans returning from Iraq are expected to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this patient, driving his car triggers an intense physiologic reactivity, as he subconsciously relives the stress of driving his vehicle in battle zones.PTSD is more common in people with a family history of mental illness. The fact that it began 3 months after the patient's return from Iraq and that it happens mainly at only one time of day makes it unlikely to be a parasite. A delay in symptom onset can be seen with PTSD.With irritable bowel syndrome, diarrhea is often worse in the morning, but this diagnosis does not account for his other problems. A normal physical examination would tend to rule out hyperthyroidism, although this possibility should still be explored. Irritability and difficulty concentrating are related to symptoms of increased arousal seen with PTSD. Depression could account for some of this patient's symptoms, but it not the most likely diagnosis given the history. ",,
3106,5,Psychiatry,"A 25-year-old female is new to your practice. She left her last physician after 6 months because &ldquo;she didn't take me seriously&rdquo;. While providing her personal history she tells you that she has been in and out of at least five &ldquo;serious&rdquo; relationships in the past 18 months. She attempted suicide on at least one occasion when she was angry with her parents. She started college after high school, but says she has not graduated yet because she has changed her major at least six times.You suspect that she has which one of the following personality disorders? ",Antisocial ,Borderline ,Schizotypal ,Dependent ,Narcissistic ,,2,"This patient displays many of the characteristics associated with borderline personality disorder, including instability in interpersonal relationships, marked impulsivity, emotional instability, and mood lability. Antisocial patients display a persistent pattern of deceitfulness, impulsivity, and disregard for the rights of others. Narcissistic patients display a grandiose sense of self-importance, tend to be demanding, appear haughty and self-absorbed, and insist on special status and treatment in the physician-patient relationship. Patients with dependent personalities struggle with the self-perception that they are unable to function adequately without the help of others. They have trouble with decision-making, motivation, and assuming responsibility, and fear abandonment. Schizotypal patients are uncomfortable in interpersonal siturations, emotionally distant, difficult to engage, and isolative, and exhibit strange or quasi-delusional beliefs. ",,

His mother says that he is frequently disruptive both at home and at school. The child speaks out of turn at school and has trouble following his teacher's instructions. His mother reports that he bickers constantly with his sister and rarely completes his daily chores. In addition, he won't sit still for longer than 2-3 minutes at a time.To make a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), it is important to keep in mind which one of the following? ",Reporting of symptoms by the parents or caregivers is not necessary ,Symptoms must have begun before age 10,Depression or a conduct disorder often coexists with ADHD ,ADHD is more commonly diagnosed in girls than boys ,Behavioral difficulties both at home and school make ADHD less likely ,,3,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity. It can involve inattention and hyperactivity combined, or it can be predominantly one or the other. The symptoms must result in some impairment in at least two setting (home, school, or on the job). Some of the symptoms must have begun before age 7, although the condition may persist into adulthood. A key source of information is the parents, caregivers, and school. Boys are diagnosed at least four times more frequently than girls. Psychiatric disabilities can coexist with ADHD, making diagnosis and treatment more difficult. ",,
3108,5,Psychiatry,Which one of the following is least likely to cause discontinuation syndrome if stopped abruptly? ,Fluoxetine (Prozac) ,Sertraline (Zoloft) ,Paroxetine (Paxil) ,Citalopram (Celexa) ,,,1,"Stopping an SSRI, or forgetting doses, can cause a discontinuation syndrome with a range of symptoms including asthenia, anxiety, agitation, GI distress, myalgias, or a sensation of electrical shocks through the arms and legs. The likelihood of the discontinuation syndrome occurring is inversely proportional to the half-life of the medication and the presence of active metabolites.Fluoxetine is the least likely of the drugs to produce a discontinuation syndrome on abrupt cessation of use, due to both its long half-life (4-6 days) and a long-acting metabolite (t1/2: 4-16 days). Paroxetine has the shortest half-life (21 h) and therefore is most likely to cause symptoms.Sertraline and citalopram have intermediate half-lives (26 h and 35 h respectively) and sertraline has an active metabolite (t1/2: 21/2-41/2). These agents have an intermediate likelihood of precipitating discontinuation symptoms. ",,

Of the following, which one would be most appropriate as pharmacotherapy for this individual? ",Haloperidol (Haldol) ,Imipramine (Tofranil) ,Fluoxetine (Prozac) ,Lithium ,Carbamazepine (Tegretol) ,,3,"SSRIs have been shown to be very effective in the treatment of panic attacks. For a number of years, imipramine was used to treat panic attacks. However, a patient with prostatic hyperplasia is likely to become more symptomatic if given a tricyclic antidepressant. Haloperidol is not indicated for this problem. Lithium and carbamazepine have not been shown to be effective in the treatment of panic disorder.  ",,
3110,5,Psychiatry,The most significant adverse effect of clozapine (Clozaril) is ,Agranulocytosis ,Syncope,Hyperkalemia ,Tardive dyskinesia ,Constipation,,1,"Agranulocytosis is the most significant adverse effect of clozapine. Weekly WBC counts are mandatory for patients receiving clozapine. The period is maximal risk is 4-18 weeks after the initiation of therapy. Older women appear to be at highest risk, and genetic factors may also be involved. Clozapine is the only antipsychotic drug for which the risk of tardive dyskinesia is low or nonexistent. ",,
3116,1,Medicine,Which one of the following studies is indicated for patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS)? ,Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing,A creatine phosphokinase level,A CBC,A serum ferritin level,Electromyography,,4,"A high prevalence of iron deficiency has been found among patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS), and treatment of the deficiency has been reported to improve or resolve symptoms. A low serum ferritin level (50 mg/L) has been associated with greater severity of RLS and with a reduction in the quantity of sleep as determined by polysomnography. In patients with a serum ferritin level 18 mg/L, treatment with oral iron supplements resulted in improvements in the severity of the symptoms of RLS and, in some patients, complete resolution of symptoms.Because RLS may be a symptom of iron deficiency and because iron deficiency is frequently present in the absence of anemia, iron status (serum ferritin and iron saturation) should be assessed. No other laboratory tests are routinely indicated.",,

In other words, it is a measure of the test's ability to properly identify those who do not have the disease. Conversely, the sensitivity of a screening test is the proportion of those with the condition who test positive.

3118,1,Medicine,"A 56-year-old white male has New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III chronic heart failure. Despite conventional therapy with appropriate dosages of a diuretic, an ACE inhibitor, and a &szlig;-adrenergic blocker, his left ventricular ejection fraction hovers around 35%, and he continues to have dyspnea on exertion. At a recent office visit his electrolytes were within normal limits. After you obtain an EKG during an office visit today, you consider adding digoxin to his treatment regimen.Which one of the following is true regarding digoxin therapy in this situation? ",It is the treatment of choice if the patient's EKG shows atrioventricular block,It is not likely to improve the ejection fraction,A loading dose will be necessary,Serial drug levels are generally not necessary,A reasonable dosage is 0.50 mg/day orally,,4,"Digoxin remains a useful drug in the management of chronic heart failure caused by systolic dysfunction. Randomized, controlled studies have convincingly confirmed its efficacy in improving ejection fraction and submaximal exercise capacity. Current consensus guidelines recommend its use for patients in whom NYHA class II&ndash;IV symptoms persist despite conventional therapy with diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and &szlig;-adrenergic blockers. Digoxin should not be administered to a patient who has an atrioventricular block, unless it is first treated with a permanent pacemaker. Loading doses of digoxin are not necessary during initiation of therapy for patients with chronic heart failure, and serial assessments of serum digoxin levels are not necessary in most patients.The radioimmunoassay was developed to assist in the evaluation of toxicity, rather than the efficacy of the drug. There appears to be little relationship between serum digoxin concentration and the drug's therapeutic effect. The dosage of digoxin should be 0.125&ndash;0.25 mg daily in the majority of patients. Higher doses (e.g., 0.375&ndash;0.50 mg) are rarely needed, especially as initial therapy for chronic heart failure.",,
3119,4,Pediatrics,"A 15-year-old white male complains of bilateral foot pain. He does not recall any injury, and the pain improves with rest. Examination reveals tenderness over the lateral and anterior ankle, along with a rigid flatfoot, peroneal tightness, and pain on foot inversion.The most likely diagnosis is: ",tarsal coalition,stress fracture,plantar fasciitis,turf toe,foot sprain,,1,"Tarsal coalition is the fusion of two or more of the tarsal bones. It is congenital, and 50% of the time is bilateral. It is asymptomatic until early adolescence. On clinical examination there is tenderness over the subtalar joint (lateral and anterior ankle), rigid flatfoot, limited subtalar motion, peroneal tightness, and pain on foot inversion. Treatment is conservative.A stress fracture would present with pain in the forefoot, warmth, mild swelling, and point tenderness over the affected metatarsals, most commonly the second or third. Radiographs are often negative initially, but a callus is usually evident by the third week of symptoms. Plantar fasciitis presents with pain in the heel or sole of the foot and is most painful with the first step after arising from bed or prolonged sitting. It may be associated with pes planus (flat foot), but in plantar fasciitis the flat foot is flexible, not rigid. Turf toe is inflammation of the first metatarsophalangeal joint due to acute and/or repetitive hyperextension injury resulting from sudden toe-off against an unyielding surface, such as artificial turf. The patient may present acutely with a tender, red, swollen first metatarsophalangeal joint, with pain on passive extension. Others may develop a chronic condition and present with hallux rigidus. Foot sprain is a nonspecific term for an acute ligamentous injury.",,

She describes the pain as sharp and stabbing, and indicates that it is located at the left sternal border; it is increased by coughing and palpation. There is no family history of heart disease, nor is there a personal history of diabetes, hypertension, smoking, or hyperlipidemia. A physical examination, an EKG, and chest radiographs are all normal.Further diagnostic studies should include: ",a treadmill exercise test with EKG and blood pressure monitoring,a stress echocardiogram,stress myocardial perfusion imaging,referral for cardiac catheterization,no additional tests,,5,"This patient exhibits atypical (noncardiac) chest pain and has no risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD). Since the likelihood of coronary disease is very low, stress testing is not indicated. For patients with typical chest pain and risk factors, the probability of CAD is high and it is usually best to proceed directly to cardiac catheterization. In individuals with an intermediate probability of CAD who are able to exercise, the choice is treadmill testing if they have an interpretable EKG, no evidence of left ventricular dysfunction, and no history of previous coronary artery bypass surgery. If the baseline EKG is not interpretable (due to left bundle branch block, early repolarization, left ventricular hypertrophy, or digoxin use) then an exercise test with imaging (nuclear or echocardiographic) is indicated. Those unable to exercise can have pharmacologic stress testing with imaging.",,

The patient is admitted to the hospital with &ldquo;do not resuscitate&rdquo; (DNR) orders and supportive measures are instituted. A neurology consultant evaluates her and agrees that her condition is terminal and irreversible.

","Institution of aggressive medical therapies, including full resuscitation in the event of\r\ncardiac arrest and ventilator support in the event of respiratory arrest","Continuation of a supportive treatment plan, provided full resuscitation is initiated in\r\nthe event of cardiac arrest and ventilator support is provided in the event of respiratory\r\narrest","Performance of full CPR for cardiopulmonary arrest, but no ventilator support for\r\nrespiratory failure",Continuation of the current treatment plan,,,4,"An adult patient or their legally authorized representative has the right to refuse any medical treatment, regardless of its likelihood of success; however, there is no legal right to receive any and all treatment demanded. When patients have explicit advance directives in writing, their wishes are clear. When no written document exists, but the patient's desire is well known to his or her physician, the physician is ethically bound to honor these wishes. This responsibility must be balanced against the physician's ethical obligation not to perform futile treatments of no benefit to the patient. A family member acting as a medical decision-making proxy is obligated to represent what they believe to be the patient's wishes, even in the face of conflict with their personal beliefs.This case highlights two commonly encountered issues: honoring the patient's wishes when there is conflicting evidence of what their wishes may be, and withholding medically futile treatment. In this case, the futility of the patient's condition overrides any confusion as to her wishes, and the admission treatment plan is the most appropriate. Naturally, it would be best to discuss this with the nephew and attempt to arrive at a consensus, with the patient's best interest being the primary concern.",,

The symptoms reminded him of an allergic reaction to peanuts he had when he was a child, so he self-administered a dose of adrenalin from his EpiPen kit 15 minutes ago. His itching and wheezing have improved, and he asks what else he should do.What advice should you provide? ",He should take oral diphenhydramine (Benadryl) now and prednisone for 3 days,He should go to the nearest emergency department,He should schedule a comprehensive reevaluation by an allergist,No further action is needed,,,2,"Patients with peanut allergy can have reactions to infinitesimal amounts of peanut protein, including residue on the lips of other people. This patient has successfully interrupted the course of anaphylaxis. Diphenhydramine can help reduce subsequent symptoms, and prednisone is generally given, although its value is unproven. However, the patient is at risk of a biphasic reaction and should go to an emergency department where additional adrenalin and resuscitation facilities are available. The Academy of Pediatrics guideline recommends that all peanut-allergic patients who require a dose of adrenalin be observed in an emergency department for at least 4 hours.Patients who have not already had a full allergy evaluation need to see an allergist, but this patient's peanut allergy has been established. Currently, desensitization is ineffective and has a high complication rate, but in the future an agent that blocks IgE may be available.

3124,5,Psychiatry,Which one of the following is the leading risk factor for delirium?,Alcohol abuse,Depression,Dementia,Malnutrition,Stroke,,3,"The cause of delirium is typically multifactorial. The development of delirium involves the complex interaction between the vulnerable patient (one with predisposing factors) and exposure to precipitating factors.Delirium affects 10%30% of hospitalized patients who are medically ill. The prevalence is even higher in certain subgroups. For example, 25% of hospitalized patients with cancer, 30%40% of hospitalized patients with HIV infection, and more than 50% of postoperative patients develop delirium during hospitalization. Among nursing-home residents older than 75, up to 60% may have delirium at any time.Dementia is the leading risk factor for delirium, and fully two-thirds of delirium cases occur in patients with dementia. The underlying vulnerability of the brain in patients with dementia may predispose them to the development of delirium as a result of insults related to acute medical illnesses, medications, or environmental changes.Unless the physician recognizes that dementia is a risk factor for delirium, the confusion and agitation associated with delirium can mistakenly be attributed to preexisting dementia. This can lead to a failure to search for underlying medical conditions or to discontinue medications that may be causing the delirium.",,

He has a history of constipation, with passage of hard, large-caliber stools approximately once a week. Encopresis also is a problem, with accidental passage of loose stool. His general examination is negative, but he and his mother refuse to allow a digital rectal examination. He does have a normal anal wink and cremasteric reflex.Which one of the following tests would be most appropriate at this time? ",CT of the abdomen,Ultrasonography,A barium enema,An abdominal plain film,Referral for pediatric colonoscopy,,4,"A child passing infrequent, large-caliber stools, often with fecal soiling, suggests functional constipation. Encopresis often results from passage of loose stool around hardened stool in the rectal vault. A physical examination will sometimes reveal palpable stool in the left lower quadrant. If possible, a digital rectal examination should be done. If this isn't possible, a plain-film abdominal radiograph will likely reveal a fecal impaction. A CT scan and a barium enema are not as helpful. Functional constipation can be managed without colonoscopy.Constipation in children older than 1 year of age is functional in more than 95% of cases. However, causes of organic constipation include Hirschsprung's disease, hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, cystic fibrosis, gluten enteropathy, spinal cord lesions, neurofibromatosis, heavy metal poisoning, medication side effects, developmental delay, and sexual abuse.",,

It also is useful for suspected umbilical cord compression during labor. Amnioinfusion has been used for preterm rupture of membranes and oligohydramnios, but there is not enough evidence to support its use.

3131,1,Medicine,"A 50 year old female reports a 1-month history of pain in her wrists. She does not recall any injury. On examination both wrists are warm but not red. They feel boggy to touch and lack 30 degrees of both flexion and extension. No other joints are affected. She feels fatigued and unwell, but attributes this to her busy schedule.Radiographs of her wrists are normal. Laboratory findings are unremarkable except for a mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and a negative rheumatoid factor.What is the most likely diagnosis? ",Rheumatoid arthritis,Osteoarthritis,Inapparent injury,Fibromyalgia,Lyme disease,,1,"Rheumatoid arthritis is most often symmetric at presentation and particularly affects the wrists and other extremity joints that have a high ratio of synovium to articular cartilage. In the early months of the disease, rheumatoid factor is often negative, even in cases where it will be positive later. Although radiographs and laboratory tests are helpful, the diagnosis is primarily clinical. Osteoarthritis of the wrists usually involves the carpal-metacarpal joint of the thumb primarily, and the joint would be red only if there were an injury. Fibromyalgia usually involves the soft tissue of the trunk, and does not produce visible inflammation. Lyme disease can cause a variety of joint diseases, but not chronic symmetric arthritis.",,
3142,1,Medicine,"An elderly female with Alzheimer's disease is admitted to the hospital for pneumonia. She has not been eating well for several weeks, so her family requests that she be started on megestrol (Megace) for appetite stimulation.Which one of the following statements is true regarding this drug? ",It stimulates the appetite center of the thalamus,It increases the release of growth hormone,It is associated with bleeding secondary to platelet dysfunction,It is a glucocorticoid derivative,It can result in adrenal suppression,,5,"Megestrol acetate is a synthetic progestational agent that is used to increase appetite in a variety of cachexia-inducing illnesses. It has been associated with weight gain in well-designed, randomized trials in populations of patients with a malignant disease or HIV infection. Its mechanism of action is unknown. Megestrol acetate doses greater than 160 mg/day can suppress ACTH secretion, leading to secondary adrenal insufficiency. For patients who are on chronic treatment or who are being withdrawn from chronic treatment, consideration should be given to empiric glucocorticoid treatment during times of stress, illness, or surgery. Megestrol acetate is associated with thrombophlebitis and pulmonary embolus, but not excessive bleeding.",,

She has a history of increasing angina pectoris leading to coronary artery bypass surgery 3 years ago. She has generally done well since the surgery, and you have provided appropriate medical management for postoperative coronary artery disease. She has reduced her cigarette smoking, but still smokes and leads a sedentary lifestyle.In addition to emphasizing smoking cessation and recommending an exercise program, which one of the following would be most effective for managing this patient's intermittent claudication? ",Cilostazol (Pletal),Clopidogrel (Plavix),Pentoxifylline (Trental),Ginkgo biloba,Aspirin,,1,"Of the medications currently available for the treatment of intermittent claudication, cilostazol is the most effective. A meta-analysis of eight randomized, placebo-controlled trials of cilostazol for moderate to severe claudication found that 100 mg of the drug twice daily increased maximal and pain-free walking distances by 50% and 67%, respectively. Clopidogrel may be marginally more effective than aspirin as an antiplatelet agent, but is more expensive. Neither pentoxifylline nor ginkgo biloba, a non&ndash;FDA-approved dietary supplement with antiplatelet, vasodilating, and antioxidant activity, has been shown to be more effective than placebo. At best, they would be a weak intervention for peripheral artery disease.",,

His heart rate is controlled, and he is anticoagulated first with low molecular weight heparin and then with warfarin (Coumadin). His INR at discharge is 2.3. He presents 3 days later for follow-up and states that he feels well. His INR is now 10.0.The most appropriate management at this time would be to withhold warfarin until his INR is therapeutic and to: ","readmit for monitoring, give vitamin K, and start enoxaparin (Lovenox)",administer 2 units of fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K subcutaneously,administer vitamin K intravenously,administer vitamin K intramuscularly,administer vitamin K orally,,5,"The most cost-effective management for excessive anticoagulation is to administer oral vitamin K and retest the prothrombin time. This patient is not hemorrhaging, and a recent analysis has shown oral vitamin K to be as effective as intravenous or subcutaneous vitamin K. An INR greater than 8.0 does carry a risk of bleeding, so simply withholding warfarin would not be appropriate, and neither would readmission, given the high likelihood of correcting the patient's excessive anticoagulation with oral vitamin K alone.",,

He calls your office 5 days later because of a 3-day history of influenza-like symptoms, insomnia, nausea, and dizziness, which were moderately severe initially but are now improving.Which one of the following would be most appropriate at this time?",Wait to see if the symptoms completely resolve,Prescribe an antiviral medication,Restart the paroxetine,Restart the paroxetine at twice the previous dosage,Hospitalize the patient,,1,"This patient has developed antidepressant discontinuation syndrome. Proposed criteria for SSRI discontinuation syndrome include the presence of anxiety, diarrhea, dizziness, fatigue, gait/balance disturbance, gastrointestinal upset, hyperarousal, insomnia, instability, lightheadedness, paresthesia, tremor, vertigo and visual disturbance. Two or more of these must be present within 7 days of discontinuation of an SSRI after at least 1 month's use.Because this patient's symptoms are resolving quickly, it is unlikely to be influenza and does not warrant hospitalization. The patient could restart the SSRI, but if this were a relapse of his depression the symptoms would not be resolving. Doubling the dosage of the medication is inappropriate because the patient was doing well on the original dosage, and the symptoms do not indicate worsening depression.",,
3136,1,Medicine,Which one of the following is true regarding placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube in severely demented patients? ,Survival is prolonged,Aspiration risk is reduced,Pressure ulcer risk is increased,Patient comfort is enhanced,Nutritional status is improved,,3,"The number of cases of dementia is expected to quadruple in the next 50 years. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes are increasingly placed, despite a paucity of evidence for their benefit. Bedfast, incontinent, demented patients with PEG tubes are more likely to be restrained, while at the same time producing more urine, thereby increasing the risk for pressure ulcers. Neither survival nor nutritional status has been found to be improved through the use of PEG tubes. Since stomach contents and saliva cannot be kept out of the airways after PEG placement, aspiration risk is not reduced.Tube-fed patients may be denied the pleasure of eating and/or made uncomfortable by the tube or by frequent repositioning or restraining. No studies suggest that tube feeding makes demented patients more comfortable.",,

They have proven efficacy with a relatively low risk profile. Cromolyn has a good safety record but somewhat disappointing results. Its effectiveness is limited compared to that of inhaled corticosteroids. Long-acting -agonists with inhaled corticosteroids are more often used in more severe persistent asthma, as they decrease the frequency of attacks. There is some controversy about their effect on mortality.Leukotriene receptor antagonists are probably a reasonable add-on therapy for asthma in pregnancy. They are not as effective as inhaled corticosteroids, however, and do not have as long a track record of safety. Leukotriene synthesis inhibitors are not recommended for use in pregnancy.",,

Symptoms can begin during either childhood or adulthood, but it classically presents as night blindness during adolescence, secondary to the initial degeneration of rods. As the disease progresses peripheral vision worsens but central vision is frequently spared, so that reading is still possible. Tunnel vision follows as peripheral vision worsens. Later, as the cones degenerate, color blindness and central visual loss progress. Eye pain is not a part of this process.",,

The area of tenderness is about the size of a quarter. All ligaments of the knee are intact on examination. There is no knee effusion. A radiograph is negative except for minimal degenerative changes.Which one of the following should you suspect? ",De Quervain's tendinitis,Prepatellar bursitis,Bursitis of the medial collateral ligament,Anserine bursitis,Third degree medial collateral ligament injury,,4,"Anserine bursitis is characterized by pain, particularly at night, that occurs in the medial knee region over the upper tibia. It is located about 2&ndash;3 cm below the medial joint line. It can be bilateral. A diagnosis of anserine bursitis requires local tenderness confined to a quarter-sized area of the medial tibial plateau, approximately 3 cm below the medial joint line; a negative valgus stress maneuver, which indicates an intact medial collateral ligament; and a normal radiograph of the tibia indicating no underlying pathology. &gt;De Quervain's tendinitis is located in the wrist region, not the knee. &gt;Prepatellar bursitis is characterized by knee swelling and pain over the front of the knee. &gt;Bursitis that occurs adjacent to the medial collateral ligament typically presents with tenderness over the medial aspect of the knee. &gt;Medial joint line pain is characteristic of osteoarthritis, second and third degree medial collateral ligament injuries, medial meniscal tears, and fractures of the tibial plateau.",,

Although the only cure for eclampsia is delivery, the patient should be stabilized first. -Fetal bradycardia is an expected occurrence during an eclamptic seizure and does not necessitate an emergency cesarean section unless it fails to resolve within a few minutes. -Lorazepam is frequently used to control seizures in nonpregnant patients, but magnesium sulfate is the agent of choice for an eclamptic seizure. [note: benzodiazepine or phenytoin can be used for seizures that are not responsive to magnesium sulfate]-A fetal scalp electrode can be helpful to confirm fetal heart tones, but should not take precedence over trying to control the seizure. -Terbutaline is a tocolytic agent that does not have a role in the acute management of an eclamptic seizure.",,

In addition to daily viscid, often purulent sputum production with occasional hemoptysis, wheezing and dyspnea occur in 75% of patients. Emphysema and chronic 1 bronchitis, forms of COPD, also cause a decreased FEV :FVC ratio, but the baseline sputum is generally mucoid and luminal dilatation of bronchi is not characteristically present. Bronchiolitis is usually secondary to respiratory syncytial virus infection in young children. Asthma is not characterized by the sputum and CT findings seen in this patient.",,
3147,1,Medicine,"A high-school football player reports a history of progressive inability to participate over a month's time. Initially he had double vision following a practice. He was better the following morning, but his symptoms recurred during the next day's practice. Now he has double vision most of the time, except right after sleeping. He says his strength and agility are declining, and his coach thinks he is playing too poorly to remain on the team.On examination he has mild ptosis, which increases if he tries to maintain an upward gaze. His arm strength is initially 5/5, but he tires very rapidly. After a few minutes of isotonic exertion he cannot lift his arms against gravity.

",Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome,Psychophysiologic weakness,Second impact syndrome,Myasthenia gravis,Myotonic dystrophy,,4,"Myasthenia gravis is a disease of the motor end plate, most often affecting the cranial nerves, especially the oculomotor nerves and the eyelids. The disease begins with weakness and fatigue, but can progress over days to months. Confirmatory testing consists of acetylcholine receptor antibody testing or electromyography when the situation is not urgent. When the diagnosis must be made promptly, the old-fashioned Tensilon test gives immediate and dramatic results.Deep tendon reflexes are lost in Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, which is an autoimmune polyneuropathy affecting the longest nerves preferentially. Myasthenia seems so odd that it can be mistaken for hysterical or stress-related symptoms. Myotonic dystrophy becomes progressively symptomatic in its victims, and is not always diagnosed before adulthood, but it does not cause double vision, and affected individuals would not be athletes at any point in their lives. They have general weakness and a typical facial appearance. Second impact syndrome is a potentially lethal response to repeated head injury.",,

This condition is most often caused by coliform bacteria in men over the age of 35 (and in homosexual males). These organisms are effectively treated with ofloxacin. Those less than age 35 with this condition have a higher chance of having a sexually transmitted disease (STD) and would benefit from intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline. However, these medications would not adequately cover coliform bacteria. Clindamycin and famciclovir would also be ineffective. Testicular torsion is another possible cause of testicular pain with a quick onset, and would require urgent urologic surgery consultation. However, in cases of torsion the examination usually reveals an elevated testicle and testicular ultrasonography would show decreased or absent blood flow on the affected side.",,

It is four times more common in women, most often occurs at 40&ndash;50 years of age, and is usually attributed to a viral infection. Symptoms and signs of this disorder include a prodrome of myalgias, pharyngitis, low-grade fever, and fatigue, followed by a tender, diffuse goiter and neck pain that often radiates up to the ear. Hyperthyroidism is seen in half of affected individuals, and must be differentiated from that found with Graves' disease to determine appropriate treatment. The hallmarks of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis are a very high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), often as high as 60-100, and a radioiodine uptake of less than 1% at 24 hours (whereas in those with Graves' disease it is elevated). Treatment consists of relieving the thyroid pain and tenderness with NSAIDs. If no improvement occurs in a week, prednisone may be given in a dosage of 40&ndash;60 mg/day, tapered off over 4&ndash;6 weeks.Suppurative thyroiditis is an extremely rare form of thyroiditis caused by bacterial, fungal, mycobacterial, or parasitic infection of the thyroid gland. Predisposing factors include congenital abnormalities such as persistent thyroglossal duct or piriform sinus fistula, greater age, and immunosuppression. Patients commonly present with acute unilateral anterior neck pain and erythema of the skin overlying an exquisitely tender thyroid. Fever, dysphagia, and dysphonia are also present. Thyroid function most often is normal, but hyper- or hypothyroidism may be present. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is elevated, and the WBC count shows a marked increase with a left shift. Fine-needle aspiration with a Gram stain and culture is the most useful diagnostic test.",,

There was no decrease in cardiovascular mortality or all-cause mortality in either sex, and there was a trend toward increased risk of stroke, primarily hemorrhagic stroke. There was a 24% decrease in ischemic stroke in women, however. The risk of major bleeding disorders was around 76% higher in aspirin users.

Mycoplasma pneumonia can spread among family members, but it is milder and has a more indolent onset and a longer incubation period. Bacterial bronchitis is an overdiagnosed, supposed complication of upper respiratory infections, and is not contagious. While the phrase &ldquo;cold and flu&rdquo; is often used, upper respiratory infections are not so febrile or prostrating, and coryza is the dominant syndrome sooner or later.

The unit of care comprises the patient and his or her family as defined by the patient or surrogate.The care plan changes according to the evolving needs and preferences of the patient and the family, and may involve additional input from other specialists and caregivers. The care team should help patients and families understand any changes that occur in the condition and how they affect ongoing care and goals of treatment. The evolving care plan should be documented clearly throughout, including alternative options for settings and treatment, and should be conveyed to all involved.The management of pain should incorporate pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and complementary therapies. Barriers to effective pain management, such as fear of side effects, addiction, or respiratory depression, should be recognized and addressed. Because controlled substances are often used for long-term symptom management, palliative care professionals need to work with policy makers, law enforcement representatives, and regulators to ensure that efforts to address drug abuse do not interfere with the care of patients who are in pain.",,

Examination shows a 2-cm area of yellow crust on his right cheek. There is no surrounding erythema. Examination of the nose and throat reveals normal findings.Which one of the following would be the most appropriate treatment? ,Amoxicillin,Cephalexin (Keflex),Mupirocin cream (Bactroban),Watchful waiting,"Warm, wet packs",,3,"Impetigo is caused by group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus and/or Staphylococcus aureus, and is one of the most common skin infections in children. Even though it is thought to be self limiting, treatment is recommended because of its contagiousness.Amoxicillin would not cover Staphylococcus, and sometimes it is difficult to get young children to take oral antibiotics. In addition, they increase the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea or allergic reactions. Mupirocin cream has been found to be just as effective as oral antibiotics in cases of limited infections.",,

There is no evidence that regular exercise, dietary soy, various phytoestrogen preparations, black cohosh, or other alternative therapies are effective in improving menopausal hot flashes. Studies have shown little or no benefit from clonidine. Paroxetine has been shown to have modest value in the treatment of hot flashes.",,

",Congenital long QT syndrome,Congenital short QT syndrome,Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome,Aortic stenosis,,3,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes in Canada. It is autosomal dominant with variable penetrance. Subaortic stenosis is present in about 25% of cases (also known as idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis or asymmetric septal hypertrophy). Symptoms range from none to weakness, fatigue, exertional dyspnea, dizziness, chest pain, and syncope. A systolic ejection murmur increasing with the Valsalva maneuver is present in many cases. Long QT syndrome and aortic stenosis are also causes of sudden death in the young athlete, but are less common.",,

Recent comprehensive investigations and reviews have demonstrated that the use of recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and a high risk for death does improve survival. Activated protein C (APC) is an endogenous protein that has natural anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory effects. Its levels are low in septic shock, which is hypothesized to exacerbate the proinflammatory response and microthrombus formation in end-organ vascular beds that leads to organ dysfunction. Exogenous administration of APC has been shown to improve the mortality in a very ill subset of patients with septic shock. Having an anticoagulant effect, use of APC increases the risk for serious bleeding.Low-dose dopamine should not be used for maintenance or improvement of renal function. Antithrombin administration is not recommended for the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock. As a specific treatment for anemia associated with severe sepsis, erythropoietin has not been shown to be of benefit. There is no evidence to support the use of bicarbonate in the treatment of hypoperfusion-induced acidemia associated with sepsis.",,
3162,1,Medicine,"A 36-year-old male who recently immigrated from Rwanda presents with a several-month history of cough accompanied by hemoptysis and weight loss. He is afebrile, and a lung examination is normal. A chest radiograph shows a cavitary lesion in his left upper lobe. He is admitted to the hospital and placed in respiratory isolation. A tuberculin test is positive, but three induced sputum smears are negative for acid-fast bacillus. Cultures are still pending.Which one of the following INITIAL treatment regimens is most appropriate? ",No treatment until culture results are available,Isoniazid for 9 months,Rifampin and pyrazinamide for 8 weeks,Rifampin and/or isoniazid for 18 weeks,"Rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide for 8 weeks",,5,"Nearly one third of the world's population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The highest per capita incidence occurs in sub-Saharan Africa. Although a positive acid-fast bacillus smear or culture for M. tuberculosis is needed to confirm active disease, treatment should begin without delay in patients for whom the clinical suspicion is high, as in this case. Because of relatively high rates of resistance to isoniazid, four drugs are necessary in the initial phase to be maximally effective. Thus, the initial treatment regimen for all adults with previously untreated tuberculosis should consist of 8 weeks of therapy with rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. Most patients will require an 18-week continuation phase after initiation. If the likelihood of active tuberculosis is low, treatment can be deferred until the results of mycobacterial cultures are known.In low-risk patients who are not initially treated, one of the other treatment regimens for latent tuberculosis is acceptable if cultures are negative, a tuberculin skin test is positive, and a chest radiograph is unchanged after 2 months. However, the 8-week regimen of rifampin and pyrazinamide should be used only in patients who are not likely to complete a longer course of therapy and who can be monitored closely because of an increased risk of hepatotoxicity.",,

These patients are often active in sports that involve a lot of jumping. It is thought to be secondary to repetitive microtrauma and traction apophysitis of the tibial tuberosity. Bilateral symptoms are present in 20%&ndash;30% of patients. Radiographs may reveal abnormalities, but are rarely indicated in straightforward cases. This condition is usually self-limited, and most patients are able to return to full activity within 2&ndash;3 weeks.

Scabies spreads by direct skin contact, and is seldom spread by transfer from bedding. Children frequently have scabies lesions on the face or neck, while this rarely happens in adults. Scabies infections usually cause itching among several family members, but they may not admit it.

3169,1,Medicine,A 26 year old white female with regular periods presents to your office with complaints of excessive hair growth. An examination reveals moderately increased facial and body hair.Which one of the following studies would you order initially to evaluate androgen excess? ,Dehydroepiandrosterone,FSH,Free testosterone,Prolactin,17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone,,3,"With mild hirsutism, regular menses, and no features to suggest a secondary cause, it is reasonable to forgo laboratory evaluation given the very high likelihood that the hirsutism is idiopathic. About half of women with moderate or severe hirsutism have androgen excess. The initial step in the workup should be measurement of plasma free testosterone in the early morning, ideally between days 4 and 10 of the menstrual cycle. If free testosterone is abnormal, further workup would include an evaluation for an underlying cause.The 2002 ACOG guidelines on hirsutism state that dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels should be measured only in cases of rapid virilization. If testosterone is elevated, ACOG recommends measurement of thyrotropin, prolactin, and early-morning levels of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone to rule out other androgen-excess disorders. ACOG suggests considering evaluation for Cushing's syndrome and other rare disorders only with suggestive symptoms or signs.If this woman with hirsutism had reported irregular menses consistent with anovulation, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) should be suspected as the cause of her androgen excess and hirsutism. The workup for PCOS should include evaluation for glucose intolerance and metabolic syndrome.",,

A single ovary is not a contraindication because it is well protected.Fever is a contraindication to participation since it increases cardiovascular effort, as well as the potential for heatstroke and orthostatic hypotension and dehydration. The rare possibility of an associated myocarditis also should be taken into account. Carditis may result in sudden death with exertion. Scoliosis should be looked into prior to allowing a child to participate in contact sports, but once the diagnosis is made it is rarely a contraindication unless the curvature is greater than 40. Sickle cell trait is not a contraindication to contact sports, although sickle cell disease can be a contraindication to strenuous activities or sports associated with significant contact.",,

His current medications include lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), metoprolol (Toprol), and low-dose aspirin. He called the clinic today with some difficulty swallowing and a swollen upper lip. He denies any hives.The patient's complaints are most likely due to: ",Ludwig's angina,cholinergic urticaria,dependent edema,angina pectoris,angioedema,,5,Angioedema is a subcutaneous or deep tissue edema from mast cell release (as in an allergic reaction) or an increase in vascular permeability from bradykinin release (as seen with ACE inhibitors) or complement system abnormalities. Ludwig's angina is a cellulitis in the submandibular or sublingual areas. Cholinergic urticaria is manifested by hives associated with sweating or hot showers. Dependent edema is swelling in the lower or dependent portions of the body and can be associated with calcium channel blockers. Angina pectoris is not a well-documented cause of angioedema.,,

",Liver toxicity is common,It decreases the rate of bone fractures,The risk of prostate cancer is increased,HDL cholesterol levels typically increase,Erythrocytosis is a potential side effect,,5,"When testosterone is taken at usual physiologic doses, liver toxicity is unusual. Testosterone replacement therapy may stop bone loss and increase bone density, but many studies have been equivocal, and none have reported a decreased rate of fractures. Although prostate cancer is thought to be stimulated by testosterone, no studies have shown convincing evidence of an increased risk of prostate cancer associated with testosterone therapy. Studies indicate that testosterone therapy either has no effect on HDL cholesterol or reduces HDL cholesterol levels. Testosterone stimulates erythropoiesis in 3%18% of men receiving testosterone therapy. Since polycythemia is a potential issue, hemoglobin levels should be monitored.",,
3176,1,Medicine,"A 42 year old African-Canadian male recently traveled to the Caribbean for a scuba diving trip. Since his return he has noted brief intermittent episodes of vertigo not associated with nausea or vomiting. He is concerned, however, because these episodes occurred after sneezing or coughing and then a couple of times after straining while lifting something. He has had no hearing loss, and no vertigo with positional changes such as bending over or turning over in bed.The most likely cause of this patient's vertigo is: ",vestibular neuronitis,Meniere's disease,benign paroxysmal positional vertigo,a perilymphatic fistula,multiple sclerosis triggered by a rapid change in climate,,4,"A perilymphatic fistula between the middle and inner ear may be caused by barotrauma from scuba diving, as well as by direct blows, heavy weight bearing, and excessive straining (e.g., with sneezing or bowel movements.) This patient's recent trip involved two of these potential factors. Vestibular neuronitis is a more sudden, unremitting syndrome. Meniere's disease is manifested by episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and often with nausea and vomiting. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is more likely in older individuals, and is associated with postural change. Multiple sclerosis requires symptoms in multiple areas and is not thought to be provoked by climate change.",,

Sudden exacerbations of asthma are common in children. Numerous treatments have been used in the past. 2-agonists have been shown to be equally effective whether administered via an inhaler and spacer device or by nebulization. As long as the gastrointestinal tract is working, intravenous corticosteroids have no benefit over oral corticosteroids. Intravenous theophylline, which once was the mainstay of treatment, now is used only in a hospital setting to treat severe asthma not responding to other treatments.

3178,1,Medicine,The most effective means of preventing sudden death in high-risk patients with asymptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is: ,amiodarone (Cordarone),metoprolol (Lopressor),"verapamil (Calan, Isoptin)",chronic dual-chamber pacing,an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD),,5,"Many patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) never have any clinical signs or symptoms. The major cause of mortality is sudden death, which can occur in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, often after physical exertion. Patients with HCM should be counseled about the risk of competitive sports and dehydration. Medications such as verapamil, beta-blockers, and diltiazem are used for symptom management, but do not decrease the risk of sudden death. Because of its effects on decreasing dysrhythmias, amiodarone may decrease the risk of sudden death, which is supported by anecdotal data.For most patients with HCM, the annual risk of dying is similar to that of the normal adult population, or 1% per year. Patients most at risk for sudden death include those with ventricular tachycardia on an ambulatory monitor, marked left ventricular hypertrophy, abnormal blood pressure response to exercise, syncope, and a family history of sudden death. At present, the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is the most effective modality for preventing sudden death in high-risk patients with asymptomatic HCM. Pacing does not reduce risk significantly.",,

In a study of CAP in 19 Canadian hospitals over a 6-month period, positive blood cultures were obtained in only 5.2%&ndash;6.2% of patients, including those with the most severe disease. Based on these findings, other researchers concluded that a positive blood culture had no correlation with the severity of illness or outcome. ATS guidelines recommend two sets of blood cultures for hospitalized patients, but this is not necessary for outpatient diagnosis.Initial treatment of CAP is empiric, and macrolides, fluoroquinolones, or doxycycline should be used in most patients, although fluoroquinolones should be used sparingly because of increasing resistance concerns. Amoxicillin/clavulanate and &szlig;-lactams are alternatives. The Pneumonia Severity Index was developed to assist physicians in identifying patients who are at higher risk of complications and are more likely to benefit from hospitalization.

The headaches occur daily around 10:00 a.m. and last 1&ndash;2 hours. He notes that the headaches bother him less when he remains active. When the headaches occur he also has tearing from the left eye and a nasal discharge from the left naris.He has found that using oxygen gives him relief. A physical examination reveals no significant findings.Which one of the following would be most appropriate at this time? ",MRI,Carbamazepine (Tegretol),Neurologic consultation,Avoiding triptan medications such as sumatriptan (Imitrex),Daily therapy with verapamil (Isoptin),,5,"Cluster headaches are repetitive headaches that occur for weeks or months at a time. They are more common in men between the ages of 30 and 50. The headaches begin without warning and reach a crescendo within minutes. Most times the headaches are located behind the eye or at the temple, and are associated with ipsilateral lacrimation, redness of the eye, nasal stuffiness, sweating, pallor, and Horner's syndrome. Patients note that they are sensitive to alcohol. They often prefer to remain active rather than rest in a dark, quiet room as someone with a migraine would likely do. A typical attack will last from 30 minutes to 3 hours. It is common for the pain to recur each day at the same time. These attacks occur 1&ndash;3 times a day over a 4- to 8-week period. The patient will often remain pain-free for 6 months to a year.A cluster headache can be distinguished from a migraine, a tension-type headache, and a brain tumor by its presentation. Headaches associated with a brain tumor are often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and worsening of the pain (which is usually bifrontal) with change in body position. There are usually positive findings on neurologic examination, as well as a change from the previous headache pattern. Migraines are more common in women and may be associated with an aura. They are throbbing in nature and accompanied by nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. These patients are usually much more comfortable in the dark. Both cluster and migraine headaches will respond to abortive therapy with triptan medications.Prophylaxis for migraine is normally begun if there are four or more attacks within a month. In contrast, once the diagnosis of cluster headache is made, it is important to initiate both abortive and prophylactic therapy right away. Abortive therapy can be with 100% oxygen, triptans, octreotide, or dihydroergotamine. A number of prophylactic medications are available, including verapamil, lithium, prednisone (short-term use only), ergotamine, cyproheptadine, and indomethacin.",,

When the ABPI is below 0.4, rest pain is a key sign to be aware of, and would indicate urgent vascular surgery to alleviate the ischemia.",,
5213,4,Pediatrics,"37 year old G2P2, has just given birth to a term baby at home, and did not have access to prenatal care during this pregnancy.  The mother was taking levothyroxine during her pregnancy for her Hashimoto's disease, but was at times forgetful.  The baby showed signs of jaundice within the first 24 hours of birth.  Two weeks later, the jaundice was still persistent, and the mother was complaining that her infant was not moving as much.  There were times when the infant would start shaking, although the episode would be brief.  Presently the infant is an abnormal posture, in which the back is severely arched and rigid.  What is the next step in management?",Look for ABO or Rh incompatibility,"Perform CBC, reticulocyte count, and blood smear",Initiate phototherapy when direct bilirubin &gt;24mg/dL,Initiate exchange transfusion,"Urinalysis and urine culture, and assess for sepsis",babywithjaundice.jpg,4,"This infant has pathological jaundice, and certainly hyperbilirubinemia as it has persisted for at least 2 weeks.  The most feared complication of jaundice in a newborn is due to elevated indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin.  We fear kernicterus in the newborn, as the bilirubin can deposit into the basal ganglia and brainstem nuclei.  Physicians must be aware of hypotonia, seizure-like activity, and opisthotonos.  Opisthotonos is a condition in which the body is held in an abnormal posture, rigidity and severe arching of the back, with the head thrown backward.  Other signs to be aware of is delayed motor skills, choreoathetosis, and sensorineural hearing loss.  We manage these cases with immediate exchange transfusion.",,

There is no good evidence to support these suppositions. The likelihood of there being infectious causes of chronic urticaria, such as Helicobacter pylori, is still being debated, but is unlikely. An autoimmune mechanism appears to be the likely cause in a subpopulation of patients, but 60% of cases appear to be idiopathic.",,

Bupropion has a good record of success in assisting patients to stop smoking. However, major contraindications to its use include a history of seizures, an eating disorder, or recent MAO inhibitor use. The other conditions listed should always be considered, but are not usually a major contraindication to bupropion use.",,

Adding a leukotriene inhibitor 2 may be effective, but is less effective than adding a long-acting 2-agonist. Leukotriene inhibitors are also less effective than intranasal corticosteroids for allergic rhinitis. Leukotriene inhibitors are considered inappropriate monotherapy for moderate persistent asthma, as they are less effective than inhaled corticosteroids. However, combined together these two medications allow significantly greater reduction in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids required to maintain clinical stability in chronic asthmatics.",,

The goal of a provider should be to decrease the difficulty of adhering to medical regimens. Using the simplest medical regimen warranted by standard clinical guidelines is helpful, with once-daily, directly observed therapy being preferable. Liquid formulations should be avoided if possible, because of the need for measuring and refrigerating. Medications with sedative effects may compromise a patient's safety on the streets or in shelters. Pseudoephedrine should be prescribed carefully, as it can be used to make methamphetamine. Albuterol can be used to enhance the effects of crack cocaine. Diuretics can be problematic for patients who have limited access to bathroom facilities during the day.",,

Putting a baby to sleep in a prone position or on his or her side increases the risk of SIDS. Sleeping on soft bedding, or with comforters, quilts, or stuffed toys also increases the risk, as does sleeping with parents or siblings. Sleeping in a separate bed or crib in the same room with the parents may be a safer alternative.",,
3192,5,Psychiatry,"A 37-year-old factory worker comes to your office because his wife thinks he has a problem. He takes no drugs and has no significant past medical history other than an episode of depression several years ago. He is not currently depressed. He says that he feels &ldquo;great,&rdquo; has plenty of energy, and is the &ldquo;fastest assembler in the plant.&rdquo; However, he does admit to being more irritable than usual and often feeling restless. On weekends and holidays he goes 48 hours without sleeping, choosing instead to spend time on the Internet, &ldquo;looking at stuff I shouldn't see and buying stuff I can't afford.&rdquo; He admits that he sometimes oversteps social boundaries by calling friends at inappropriate times of the day or expounding on his intense religious convictions.Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Attention deficit disorder,Bipolar II disorder,Generalized anxiety disorder,Borderline personality disorder,Schizophrenia,,2,"This patient's symptoms are most consistent with bipolar II disorder/hypomania. According to the DSM-IV, bipolar II disorder is characterized by one or more major depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. Hypomanic episodes consist of an elevated mood, often with expansive or irritable qualities. Patients with hypomania feel like they have abundant energy and often speak rapidly or interrupt others repeatedly. They usually are convinced of their own talent and often have intense religious and/or sexual interests. They usually have a decreased need for sleep, spend money beyond their means, and take unnecessary risks. Their intense social interest may cause them to call friends at inappropriate times, especially late at night.A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder requires a history of depression and a hypomanic state at some time in the past that caused impaired relationships or function and that is not explained by a medical condition, drugs, or other psychiatric diagnosis (i.e., schizophrenia). However, if symptoms have ever been fully manic, the diagnosis would be bipolar I disorder. Symptoms of attention deficit disorder (ADD) persist into adulthood in up to 50% of children diagnosed with ADD, and can be similar to those in this patient. There is insufficient information from his history regarding childhood symptomatology to support a diagnosis of ADHD. Although the patient notes irritability and restlessness, he does not report excessive anxiety and worry, which are the central symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. Borderline personality disorder is characterized by a similar pattern of marked impulsivity and poor social boundaries. However, it is diagnosed primarily in women (75%), and this patient apparently has been able to maintain a stable marital relationship up to this point, which would be unusual.",,

Penicillins, cephalosporins, and nitrofurantoin are commonly used in pregnancy, and there is no evidence for adverse fetal outcomes. Fluoroquinolones are contraindicated in pregnancy because they have been found to cause an irreversible arthropathy in animal studies.

Those in close contact with patients who have presumptive meningococcal disease are at heightened risk. While secondary cases have been reported, they are rare because of prompt chemoprophylaxis of household members and anyone directly exposed to the index patient's oral secretions. There is no need to isolate family members. The risk for secondary disease among closest contacts is highest during the first few days after the onset of illness in the index patient, mandating immediate chemoprophylaxis of those exposed. The delay in immunity post vaccination makes it necessary to use other preventive measures instead.",,
3196,1,Medicine,"One year after being diagnosed with early Alzheimer's disease, one of your long-time patients develops symptomatic carotid stenosis. A vascular surgeon has recommended surgical treatment, but the patient's family is uncertain whether he should have the surgery or whether he is capable of making the decision. The children are evenly split in their opinion regarding the surgery, and they ask your opinion about this decision.Which one of the following is true regarding this situation? ",The patient is incapable of making this decision because of his dementia,The Mini-Mental State Examination score determines competence,The patient should be evaluated by a psychiatrist,A judicial determination of competence should be obtained,The patient's decision-making capacity can be adequately assessed by clinical\r\nevaluation,,5,"The primary care physician can assess a patient's decision-making capacity based on ability to reason, communicate, understand the proposed treatment, and grasp the consequences of accepting or declining the suggested treatment.Formal mental status testing and determination of capacity are different functions. However, there is a certain level of cognitive impairment where a patient simply lacks any ability to receive and process health information. At somewhat higher levels of cognition a patient might lack specific mental abilities, but still be able to satisfy the requirements for making treatment decisions.Accurate mental status testing is helpful for assessing the capacity to choose; however, there is not a specific score that determines capacity. Determination of capacity does not require legal intervention or psychiatric expertise. There is no specific test for decision-making capacity.Competence is a legal term in this situation. Decisions regarding competence are judicial determinations when evaluating the capacity of a person to make nonmedical decisions such as financial decisions. Under the law, adults are presumed to be competent until a specific action of the appropriate court finds them otherwise.",,

This condition occurs in up to 20% of children during the first year of life. Spontaneous resolution occurs by 6 months of age in 90% of children, but the chance of spontaneous resolution decreases to less than 1% if the obstruction is still present at 1 year of age. This condition usually has a benign course. Referral to an ophthalmologist is indicated only if the tear duct remains clogged at 1 year of age. Antibiotics are necessary only if signs of infection arise, and daily tear duct massage can help prevent infection. Topical corticosteroids would be used only after surgery, to help keep the tear duct open.",,

For the past 2 weeks she has complained of cramping pain in her thighs and calves, which has caused her to awaken at times. Massage and occasional acetaminophen help. In the morning the symptoms are gone and daily activity is unimpaired. Her physical examination is normal. On examination she has no inflammatory signs and no joint or muscle tenderness.Which one of the following would be most appropriate at this point? ",Radiographs of the hips and knees,An erythrocyte sedimentation rate,A CBC,Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing,No further testing,,5,"This patient is experiencing benign nocturnal pains of childhood, formerly called growing pains. These are cramping pains of the thigh, shin, and calf, and affect approximately 35% of children 46 years of age. The pain typically occurs in the evening or at night, may awaken the child from sleep, and disappears by morning. This classic presentation in the absence of other inflammatory or chronic signs and symptoms should reinforce the benign nature of this condition. Physical findings are normal, so in the absence of worrisome complaints or anatomic abnormalities no further diagnostic testing is required. Parents should be reassured that there are no long-term sequelae. If activity is impaired, the physical examination is abnormal, or any constitutional or systemic complaints are present, then further evaluation with additional testing is indicated, and may include an erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CBC, antinuclear antibody, or radiographs of affected bones or joints.",,

3205,3,PMCH,Cultural traditions and ceremonies sometimes mandate actions that conflict with standard treatment regimens. Which one of the following patients would require modification of a medication schedule?,A Malaysian male experiencing koro,A Muslim during Ramadan,A Mexican affected with bilis,A Jehovah's Witness observing his birthday,A Chinese-Canadian grandmother receiving cupping treatments,,2,"In a nation as diverse as Canada, cultural sensitivity on the part of the prescribing physician is an essential component for negotiating a successful therapeutic regimen. Culture-based belief systems can be quite complex and confusing to those unfamiliar with them, but this is often overcome when the physician demonstrates sincere interest, understanding, and respect for each patient. The month-long daytime fast observed during Ramadan generally requires an adaptive dosing schedule. Jehovah's Witnesses do not, as a rule, celebrate birthdays. Cupping treatment does not affect timing of medications. Koro is a delusional state in which the affected man has a sensation that his penis is shrivelling or being drawn into his abdomen. It would not affect a medication regimen. Bilis is an outburst of anger.",,

Levofloxacin is recommended in this situation. Given the symptoms of an infectious etiology, antihistamines alone are not appropriate. While high-dose amoxicillin is recommended as a first-line therapy, it is not recommended for treatment failures. Resistance to azithromycin is fairly high after an initial antibiotic failure.",,

Iron studies are normal.In which one of the following would a normal pattern on hemoglobin electrophoresis be expected? ,Alpha-Thalassemia minor (trait),#NAME?,#NAME?,Hemoglobin SC disease,Hemoglobin H disease,,1,"Thalassemia is an inherited hematologic disorder that affects the balanced production of globin chains of the hemoglobin molecule. Normal adult hemoglobin contains two alpha chains and two  chains that are produced in equal amounts. Thalassemia minor results in a partial reduction in the production of either the alpha- or -chains. Patients with this problem usually have hypochromic, microcytic red blood cells with a normal or elevated RBC count and mildly reduced hemoglobin.In -thalassemia minor, hemoglobin electrophoresis is abnormal and shows a increased concentration of HbA2 and an decrease in HbA . In alpha-thalassemia minor alpha-chain production is reduced but there is no increase in other abnormal hemoglobins and electrophoresis is normal. If the production of alpha-chains is severely reduced it results in the production of hemoglobins with all -chains, termed Hb H, or all gamma-chains, called Hb Barts.-Thalassemia major is a severe anemic syndrome without the production of any HbA. An abnormal hemoglobin consisting of four alpha-chains is found on electrophoresis. Hemoglobin SC is an abnormal hemoglobin with amino acid substitution in the globin chain that is abnormal on electrophoresis.",,

3213,4,Pediatrics,A 10-year-old male is brought to your office with pain and swelling of the knee after falling out of a tree. A physical examination is notable for point tenderness and swelling at the proximal tibia. A radiograph shows a displaced fracture of the proximal tibia through the physis and epiphysis.The most appropriate management is: ,a long leg cast,a rigid knee immobilizer,a functional (hinged) knee immobilizer,orthopedic referral,,,4,"Physeal injuries are unique to children, and account for approximately one-fourth of all pediatric fractures. This child has a Salter-Harris fracture that requires referral to an orthopedist. Salter-Harris type I injury is a fracture through the hypertrophic cartilage that causes widening of the physeal space. These fractures are difficult to diagnose radiographically, but their clinical hallmark is point tenderness at the epiphyseal plate. Type II fractures are the most common, and extend through both the physis and metaphysis. Although these fractures may result in some shortening, they rarely cause functional deformities. Type III injuries extend through the physis and epiphysis, disrupting the reproductive layer of the physis. These injuries may cause chronic sequelae because they disrupt the articular surface of the bone, but they do not produce deformities and generally have a good prognosis.Type IV injuries cross through the epiphysis, physis, and metaphysis. These fractures are also intra-articular, increasing the risk for chronic disability. They can disrupt the proliferative zone, leading to early fusion and growth deformity. Type V fractures are the least common but most difficult to diagnose, and have the worst prognosis. The classic mechanism of injury is an axial force that compresses the epiphyseal plate without an overt fracture of the epiphysis or metaphysis.",,

This lesion developed a scaly border and began to clear centrally. A week later, similar smaller lesions developed on her back, trunk, and proximal extremities. The long axis of these oval lesions followed the cleavage lines of the skin. The patient treated these lesions with over-the-counter hydrocortisone and diphenhydramine (Benadryl), but they did not resolve.Which one of the following would be the most appropriate management at this time? ",Famciclovir (Famvir),Prednisone,Cetirizine (Zyrtec),Terbinafine (Lamisil),Reassurance,,5,"Pityriasis rosea is a self-limited, acute exanthematous skin disorder that is thought to be viral. It begins with a herald patch that is 35 cm in size and usually precedes the rash on the trunk and back by a week. This is followed by central clearing of the lesion, with development of a scaly border. Smaller, similar lesions usually develop in the cleavage lines of the skin. The salmon or pink patches may be mistaken for tinea corporis, especially when the herald patch is present. Other illnesses to consider include psoriasis, Lyme disease, secondary syphilis, drug eruptions, and HIV seroconversion illness. No laboratory markers are present, and a skin biopsy is rarely needed.Most patients require only reassurance, although some may need topical corticosteroids to control itching. For more severe cases, phototherapy can be considered. For unusually severe cases, erythromycin for 2 weeks may be helpful. There is one placebo-controlled study of 90 patients that showed complete rash clearance in 73% of patients who received 2 weeks of erythromycin therapy, compared with no clearance of the rash in patients who received placebo (evidence level B, single controlled trial). It is thought that the benefit is from anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating effects rather than antibacterial effects. The rash may persist for 23 months.",,

",Breast milk can safely be stored at room temperature for up to 8 hours,"Frozen breast milk should be thawed quickly, preferably in a microwave oven","Once thawed, breast milk may safely be refrozen within 4 hours","If stored breast milk has separated, it is spoiled",OSHA guidelines prohibit the storage of human milk in a common refrigerator in the\r\nworkplace,,1,"With many nursing mothers returning to work it is frequently necessary to shift lactation and feeding schedules using techniques such as expressing milk with pumps and storing the excess. Human breast milk may safely be stored up to 10 hours at room temperature, up to 8 days in the refrigerator, and up to 12 months when frozen. When frozen, it should be thawed slowly to preserve nutritious proteins and should not be refrozen. Human breast milk naturally separates and can easily be re-emulsified by shaking.

3217,6,Surgery,Which one of the following would be the best treatment option for prolapse of a fourth degree hemorrhoid that cannot be reduced?,Rubber band ligation,Infrared coagulation,Injection sclerotherapy,Hemorrhoidectomy,A high-fiber diet,,4,"Hemorrhoids are divided into four categories. First degree hemorrhoids bleed with defecation but do not prolapse through the anus. They are associated with mild symptoms and usually are secondary to leakage of blood from mildly inflamed, thin-walled veins or arterioles. Conservative management with dietary manipulation (addition of fiber) and attention to anal hygiene often is adequate. Recurrent rectal bleeding may require ablation of the vessels with nonsurgical techniques (e.g., injection sclerotherapy, infrared coagulation, rubber band ligation).Second degree hemorrhoids prolapse with defecation and reduce spontaneously. These can be treated with rubber band ligation or other nonsurgical ablative techniques.Third degree hemorrhoids prolapse and require manual reduction. There is significant destruction of the suspensory ligaments. Relocation and fixation of the mucosa to the underlying muscle wall generally is necessary. Prolapse initially can be treated with rubber band ligation, although hemorrhoidectomy may be required.Fourth degree hemorrhoids prolapse and cannot be reduced. If treatment is necessary, these require hemorrhoidectomy.",,

3219,1,Medicine,"A 76 year old male has fallen twice as a result of buckling of the left knee during ambulation. Neither fall resulted in injury, and he is advised to use an offset walking cane. The patient is left handdominant and has normal strength in all four extremities. Crepitus is present in both knees, but is much more pronounced in the left knee.Which one of the following describes the best method for use of a cane by this patient? ",Place the cane in the left hand and advance it at the same time as the left leg,Place the cane in the left hand and advance it at the same time as the right leg,Place the cane in the right hand and advance it at the same time as the left leg,Place the cane in the right hand and advance it at the same time as the right leg,Switch the cane between hands at intervals of several hours to distribute the load\r\nequally,,3,"The standard walking cane generally is designed as a tool to aid in balance and, to a lesser degree, reduce weight bearing on a specific leg. The offset cane design results in the downward force vector being placed directly over the shaft, making this choice ideal where improved balance and reduction of weight bearing on a particular leg is desired. Mechanical advantage produces maximum benefit when the cane is placed in the hand opposite the most severely affected leg, and the movement of the cane tracks the movement of the affected leg, consistent with normal gait.",,
3220,1,Medicine,"A healthy 45 year old male comes to your office for a routine visit. Findings are normal on a review of systems and physical examination. After you discuss the findings and provide routine counseling about a healthy lifestyle, the patient asks if he should have a full-body CT scan just to make sure he is healthy.Which one of the following would be appropriate advice? ","This is a reasonable option, but most insurance companies will not pay for it","The chance of finding an abnormality is very low, but for a person anxious about his\r\nor her health the reassurance is worth the expense",The amount of radiation exposure from low-dose full-body CT is minimal,"In a healthy patient, incidental findings will lead to unnecessary biopsies, anxiety, and\r\nsignificant radiation exposure",,,4,"With financial incentives driving the health care industry, full-body CT has been promoted by private scanning facilities. However, the Preventive Services Task Force, the College of Radiology, and many other organizations that have studied full-body CT screening are opposed to it. No study has shown the final outcome of such screening to be in the best interest of the patient, and it may actually be detrimental.Although the initial cost of $1000 may seem high by itself, the final cost also includes the expense of further testing due to false-positive findings, the time taken off work for the initial test, and the time required for any further tests and consultations that might take place. Various studies have shown that significant disease is found in 1.9%&ndash;2.0% of those scanned, yet 87%&ndash;91% of all patients scanned will have positive findings. Of these, 37% will be asked to undergo further studies to prove the findings are benign. Findings such as noncalcified pulmonary nodules will either necessitate procedures such as lung needle biopsies or wedge resections, or will be left alone, causing increased anxiety to the patient and also affecting the patient's future insurability.The radiation exposure from a full-body CT scan is estimated to be equivalent to 500 chest radiographs, or 100 chest radiographs for low-dose scanning.",,

Further complicating this diagnostic challenge is the possibility that the cough may be due to multiple concurrent conditions that must each be addressed before the cough will resolve. Each of the options listed may cause chronic cough and must be considered.In order, the three most common causes of chronic cough are upper airway cough syndrome (UACS), asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis is frequent enough to warrant consideration as well. A 2001 decision analysis provides support for the strategy of treating chronic cough empirically. Since the most common cause for chronic cough is UACS (with an assumed prevalence of 44%) due to rhinosinus conditions, an empiric trial of a first-generation antihistamine/decongestant is a reasonable option. Further treatment choices are based on the response to this regimen.",,

Risk factors to be considered include HDL &lt;35 mg/dL, smoking, hypertension, family history of a first degree relative with premature atherosclerotic vascular disease (male &lt;45, female &lt;55), and age (male &gt;55, female &gt;65). In addition, an HDL-cholesterol level &gt;60 mg/dL is considered a negative risk factor.Given these thresholds, this patient has no risk factors for heart disease and is at low risk for a cardiovascular event. Her father's history of heart problems at age 65 is not a risk factor. Her blood pressure is in the prehypertensive range, but she does not need pharmacologic treatment. Her total cholesterol is mildly elevated, but the HDL level is high and treatment is not indicated to lower her LDL level since she is at low risk.The Women's Health Initiative showed that given this patient's low cardiac risk, aspirin is more likely to cause gastrointestinal bleeding or serious bleeding following trauma than to protect her from a cardiac event. Her main strategy for avoiding cardiovascular problems should be to live a healthy lifestyle and stay off medications, unless her risk factors change.",,

Lower extremity ultrasonography reveals a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in his calf. He has no previous history of blood clots.Which one of the following is the best management of this patient's DVT? ",Compression stockings and repeat ultrasonography in 2 days,Heparin therapy followed by oral anticoagulation for 3 months,Indefinite oral anticoagulation,Intravenous thrombolytic therapy,Insertion of an inferior vena cava filter,,2,"Without anticoagulation, patients with an uncomplicated calf deep vein thrombosis (DVT) have a significant risk of further clot extension, acute pulmonary embolus, or recurrence of the thrombus. They are also at risk for late complications such as the post-thrombotic syndrome or chronic thromboembolic hypertension. For this reason, monitoring a DVT by repeat ultrasonography is not a good option unless there are contraindications to anticoagulation, such as recent surgery, hemorrhagic stroke, active bleeding, or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.The recommended treatment for DVT is heparin (intravenous unfractionated or subcutaneous low molecular weight) followed by oral anticoagulation with warfarin once adequate anticoagulation is achieved. For a first episode of DVT due to an idiopathic cause or transient risk factor, such as short-term immobilization, the recommended length of treatment is 3&ndash;6 months. The benefit-to-risk ratio declines after 6 months unless the patient has a recurrent DVT or a known chronic risk factor, such as a thrombophilic condition or cancer.Thrombolytic therapy with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase, or streptokinase typically is reserved for patients with life-threatening pulmonary embolism.

However, the diagnosis cannot be based solely on the hematocrit result. Therefore, to help make the diagnosis, a test that uses radioactively labeled red blood cells to determine the total number of red blood cells in the body (red blood cell mass) is sometimes done. Once the increased red blood cell mass (polycythemia) is discovered, one must then determine whether it is polycythemia vera or polycythemia caused by some other condition (secondary polycythemia). Blood levels of erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cells, also is measured.

Some studies indicate a better response with less chronic fractures. Treatment of fractures less than 6 months old is acceptable. More prolonged conservative therapy with an inadequate response is not appropriate.Neurologic dysfunction, including bladder dysfunction, paralysis, and sensory deficits, is a relative contraindication to vertebroplasty. Spinal cord compression requires other treatment, and high degrees of compression (67%) are not amenable to this therapy. Destruction of the posterior wall is a contraindication to this therapy because the injected polymethyl methacrylate should not directly contact the spinal cord. Coagulopathies and infectious processes are also contraindications.",,

3245,3,PMCH,"An 18-year-old white female who works at a day-care center sees you because of a cough. Three weeks ago she developed cold symptoms that have progressed to paroxysms of coughing with post-tussive emesis. She reports that there are children at the day-care center who have coughs and colds, but none have been diagnosed with pertussis. She has always been healthy, has no known drug allergies, and had all of the routine childhood immunizations. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is negative for pertussis and a chest film appears normal.Which one of the following would be most appropriate at this point?",Tetanus diphtheria acellular pertussis (TDaP) vaccine,Albuterol,Promethazine,Azithromycin (Zithromax),Prednisolone (Orapred),,4,"This person works in an environment where pertussis may be contracted from unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated individuals. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) this patient has &ldquo;clinical&rdquo; pertussis, defined as an acute cough for 14 days with no other apparent cause, plus one of the following: paroxysmal cough, post-tussive emesis, or inspiratory &ldquo;whooping.&rdquo; A negative PCR does not exclude clinical pertussis.The CDC recommends treating clinical cases with erythromycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin. Because pertussis is highly contagious, antibiotics are recommended to control outbreaks.The effectiveness of symptom-reducing treatments (e.g., antihistamines, corticosteroids, &szlig;-agonists, or immunoglobulins) is unclear. A systematic review showed little evidence to justify their use for pertussis. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices no longer recommends the Td booster, and Td would not boost her immunity to pertussis. Because of the waning of pertussis immunity after routine childhood immunizations, the newer tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine is recommended for adolescents. Although it is unclear whether this patient needs Tdap because of boosted immunity resulting from clinical pertussis, immunization would not be the first treatment in this case.",,

",The serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) test can accurately differentiate diastolic\r\nfrom systolic heart failure,Optimal treatment for systolic heart failure is necessary to treat diastolic heart failure,Drugs that inhibit the production of angiotensin or block angiotensin II receptors are\r\ncontraindicated,Calcium channel blockers reduce mortality in patients with isolated diastolic\r\ndysfunction,#NAME?,,5,"The serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) test can accurately differentiate heart failure from noncardiac conditions in a patient with dyspnea, but it cannot distinguish diastolic from systolic heart failure. Optimal treatment for systolic heart failure may exacerbate diastolic heart failure. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) directly affect myocardial relaxation and compliance by inhibiting production of angiotensin or by blocking angiotensin II receptors, thereby reducing interstitial collagen deposition and fibrosis. The indirect benefits of optimizing hemodynamics include improved left ventricular filling, reduced blood pressure, and improved exercise capacity and quality of life.Large randomized, controlled trials have not proved that calcium channel blockers reduce mortality in patients with isolated diastolic function. -Blockers control heart rate and prevent tachycardia, thereby maximizing diastolic filling in patients with diastolic dysfunction. They also reduce blood pressure and myocardial ischemia, promote regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, and antagonize the excessive adrenergic stimulation that occurs with heart failure. -Blockers also have been independently associated with improved survival in patients with diastolic heart failure.",,
3250,1,Medicine,"A 40-year-old white male was seen 4 weeks ago for a sudden onset of cough and shortness of breath. At that visit his oxygen saturation was 92%, but his examination and a chest radiograph were normal. You prescribed azithromycin (Zithromax) and an albuterol inhaler. Ten days later he was feeling well and his oxygen saturation was 97%. Today, he returns to the office with a dry cough and shortness of breath.On examination he has rare inspiratory rales that clear with deep breaths, and he has an oxygen saturation of 86%. A chest film and a D-dimer test are normal. Pulmonary function tests show significant restriction that improves only minimally with albuterol. He has not been exposed to anyone with a similar illness, has no history of asthma, and has no smoking history or occupational exposure. However, he reports that 2 months ago his home was flooded after a heavy rain, and he has been tearing out carpeting that was ruined by the flood.Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ",Persistent asthma with acute exacerbations,Legionnaires' disease,"Pulmonary embolism, with lupus antibody as the most likely cause of the negative\r\nD-dimer test",Hypersensitivity pneumonitis,,,4,"Hypersensitivity pneumonitis can present in acute, subacute, or chronic forms. The case described includes two episodes of the acute form. The patient was exposed to mold antigens in his flooded home. Within 4&ndash;8 hours of exposure, chills, cough, and shortness of breath will be noted, and at times will be dramatic. A chest film can be normal, even with significant hypoxia. Pulmonary function tests will show restrictive changes, as compared to the reversible obstructive changes of acute asthma. Blood tests often show an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Serum IgG tests for the probable antigen confirm the diagnosis.Symptoms resolve over several days, but will suddenly and violently recur with repeated exposure to the offending antigen. The subacute form of hypersensitivity pneumonitis begins gradually over weeks or months, causing a cough and increasing shortness of breath. The chronic form develops over years of exposure, causing fibrotic changes to the lungs that will be evident on radiographs, as well as chronic rales on auscultation.Asthma would be an unlikely diagnosis in this case, with the pulmonary function tests showing restrictive changes rather than obstructive changes, and little improvement with albuterol. Also, the lack of a previous history of asthma makes it less likely. Legionnaires' disease is always possible, but is unlikely in this case given the sudden onset, quick recovery over several days, and sudden recurrence. Pulmonary embolism is ruled out by the negative D-dimer test.",,
3251,1,Medicine,"A 75-year-old white female presents with hyponatremia, with a serum level of 118 mEq/L, a urine osmolality 100 mOsm/kg H2O, and a serum osmolality of 242 mOsm/kg H2O. She complains of some fatigue, but is alert and oriented. Her blood pressure is 136/82 mm Hg. She has normal thyroid, adrenal, cardiac, hepatic, and renal function. You admit her to the hospital for treatment and observation.Which one of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment? ",Administration of 3% saline,Administration of normal saline,Free water restriction,Demeclocycline (Declomycin),,,3,"This patient probably has the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). SIADH can be caused by CNS tumors, various infections such as meningitis, and pneumonia. Several drugs can cause this condition, including amiodarone, carbamazepine, SSRIs, and chlorpromazine. In this fairly asymptomatic patient, initial management should be free water restriction. As she is hemodynamically stable, she does not need normal saline. Moreover, administration of normal saline may exacerbate the hyponatremia, as the sodium may be rapidly excreted while the water is retained. If she had a rapid onset and neurologic symptoms such as seizures, hypertonic saline could be given.Correction should be slow, with a goal of no more than a 12 mmol/L/hr increase in the sodium level; a normal sodium level should not be reached within the first 48 hours of treatment. Demeclocycline is appropriate for patients who cannot adhere to the requirement for fluid restriction, or who have recalcitrant hyponatremia despite restriction.",,

Radiographs demonstrate the classic Scotty dog with a collar appearance of spondylolysis.Which one of the following statements about this diagnosis is true? ,Most athletes can resume full activity in 46 weeks,Spondylolisthesis 25% requires referral to a spine surgeon,Inadequate treatment can lead to complete fracture and spondylolisthesis with\r\nprolonged disability,Adolescents should be followed with serial CT every 2 months until they reach\r\nskeletal maturity,,,3,Complete fracture and spondylolisthesis with prolonged disability may occur if spondylolysis is not diagnosed early and treated appropriately. Most athletes respond to conservative management and return to full activity approximately 6 months after diagnosis. Treatment for low-grade spondylolisthesis (up to 50% slippage) is similar to treatment for spondylolysis. Patients should be followed with serial radiographs at 6-month intervals until they reach skeletal maturity. Patients with a high-grade slippage (50%) may need to be comanaged by an orthopedic or spine surgeon to guide treatment and assist in return-to-play decisions.,,

Blunt, medium-tipped, angled forceps or commercially available devices (but not tweezers) should be used. The tick should be grasped gently and vertical traction applied until it dislodges. Using improper technique can leave a portion of the tick behind, resulting in infection or granuloma formation. Other methods, such as applying a hot match to the tick, applying or injecting lidocaine, or passing a needle through the tick, are not recommended.

On a previous ski trip to the same altitude he experienced symptoms of headache, poor sleep, anorexia, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. He asks you what he can do to prevent these symptoms on his upcoming trip.Which one of the following would you recommend? ",Caffeine avoidance,Caffeine tablets,Furosemide (Lasix),Acetazolamide (Diamox),Fluid restriction,,4,"This patient experienced acute mountain sickness (AMS), which is the most common altitude illness. It occurs in 40%50% of persons from low altitudes who ascend to 14,000 feet. The onset can occur within 8 to 96 hours of arrival at altitudes above 8000 feet, although the altitudes at which symptoms begin vary significantly. AMS is a clinical diagnosis, with the most common symptoms consisting of headache, poor sleep, anorexia, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Slow ascent is the best way to avoid AMS. Adequate hydration may be helpful. Acetazolamide and dexamethasone help prevent or mitigate the symptoms of AMS. Individuals who have had AMS in the past should probably be treated prophylactically with acetazolamide.Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that causes a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis through the loss of bicarbonate, sodium, and potassium in the urine. Respiration is stimulated by the acidosis, which leads to a compensatory respiratory alkalosis. Pretreatment with this agent mimics the acclimated state of acid-base balance, so that during the first day of altitude exposure, subjects taking this drug have values for pH, partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide, and minute ventilation that are not typically observed until day 5 in control subjects.",,

3260,5,Psychiatry,A 25-year-old female with a longstanding history of depression is doing well on her current medication. She and her husband are planning a pregnancy. Her psychiatrist has recommended that she continue taking an SSRI.Which one of the following poses the greatest risk during pregnancy?,Sertraline (Zoloft),Escitalopram (Lexapro),Citalopram (Celexa),Fluoxetine (Prozac),Paroxetine (Paxil),,5,"A recent update by the College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Obstetric Practice recommends that SSRI use during pregnancy be individualized. Most SSRIs are pregnancy category C, which means that these drugs have been found to cause teratogenic effects in animals, but there are no adequate studies in humans. However, recent data has shown that paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy may increase congenital cardiac defects, such as atrial septal defect and ventricular septal defect, and it now has been changed to pregnancy category D (found to be harmful to human fetuses). If at all possible, this drug should be avoided in pregnant women and those planning a pregnancy.SSRIs used late in pregnancy has also been associated with neonatal complications that include jitteriness, mild respiratory distress, transient tachypnea of the newborn, weak cry, poor tone, and admission to the neonatal intensive-care unit. One study showed that 30% of neonates exposed to SSRIs during late pregnancy develop a neonatal abstinence syndrome identified by a formal scoring system. A large case-controlled study found a sixfold increase in the risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension for newborns whose mothers used SSRIs after 20 weeks gestation. While there are potential risks associated with SSRI use, they must be balanced with the risks associated with stopping the medicine. Women who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy have five times the risk of relapse compared to those who take the medications. Untreated depression may increase the risk of low weight gain, sexually transmitted disease, and alcohol and substance abuse, which all may put the fetus at risk. It is important for the risks and benefits of treatment with SSRIs to be weighed and thoroughly discussed with the patient prior to treatment so she can make an informed decision.",,
3261,1,Medicine,Which one of the following is true concerning community-acquired pneumonia?,The absence of a pulmonary infiltrate on a chest film rules out pneumonia,Intravenous antibiotics are always more effective than oral antibiotics in treating\r\nuncomplicated pneumonia,"In patients with uncomplicated pneumonia, the risk of relapse is greatest on the day\r\nprior to planned discharge",Hypoxemia is rarely an indication for hospitalization,It takes several weeks for all symptoms of pneumonia to resolve,,5,"One week after their initial presentation with pneumonia, 80% of patients still have fatigue and cough. It usually takes several weeks for all manifestations to resolve and the patient to return to normal.According to the latest Thoracic Society guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), all patients with suspected CAP should have a chest radiograph to establish the diagnosis and identify complications (pleural effusion, multilobar disease). Chest radiography performed early in the course of the disease may be negative, however. Intravenous antibiotics are frequently no better than oral antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated pneumonia. The risk of relapse or worsening is greatest on the day of admission and goes down progressively after that. All patients with hypoxemia should be hospitalized.",,

Despite conventional treatment with topical agents and systemic antibiotics, she continues to experience flares of inflammatory acne and believes that her acne is severely limiting her social relationships and her ability to make a favorable impression during job interviews. She asks you about using isotretinoin (Accutane).Which one of the following would be accurate advice? ",Isotretinoin is most useful in treating comedonal acne,Concomitant therapy with topical keratolytic agents is usually well tolerated,Teratogenicity is the most devastating adverse effect,Elevations in liver enzymes often necessitate discontinuing treatment,Osteoporosis and osteophyte formation are common late complications of treatment,,3,"Isotretinoin is FDA-labeled only for treatment of severe, recalcitrant, nodular acne. Because of documented clinical experience with the drug, however, in addition to additional published evidence, there is international consensus that isotretinoin may be appropriate in other situations. These include an inadequate response to appropriate conventional therapy for less severe acne, scarring inflammatory acne, and acne that causes severe psychologic distress. When isotretinoin is used, adjuvant therapy with topical keratolytics and drying agents should be discontinued because concomitant use may lead to excessive dryness.The most devastating adverse effect of isotretinoin is teratogenicity. Major malformations may occur in 25%30% of fetuses exposed to the drug. Liver enzyme levels should be monitored periodically, although elevations beyond the reference range are rare. If elevations do occur, it may be necessary to reduce the dosage, or in rare instances to discontinue therapy. Long-term retinoid therapy may be complicated by skeletal changes, including osteoporosis and osteophyte formation. No studies have reported notable bony changes associated with short-term therapy of the duration typical for treatment of acne (usually 5 months).",,

",Carotid ultrasonography,High-resolution CT,MRI with gadolinium enhancement,Aspirin and observation,Prednisone and valacyclovir (Valtrex),,5,"Acute partial or complete paralysis of the peripheral facial nerves is called Bell's palsy. The etiology is still unknown, but it could be genetic, metabolic, autoimmune, vascular, entrapment, or infectious. There is reasonable evidence indicating that the condition may be due to reactivation of herpes simplex virus, resulting in a viral-induced neuritis.Associated infections may be viral (herpes simplex, herpes zoster, HIV, mumps, adenovirus, coxsackievirus, polio, Epstein-Barr virus, influenza) or bacterial (otitis media, Lyme disease, syphilis, leprosy). Women who are pregnant have a risk three times higher than that of nonpregnant women. Sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, and post-infectious demyelination are other possibilities. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism may be risk factors, but are probably not etiologic agents.The key diagnostic point is determining the time of onset. If the onset occurs over a day or two and maximal paralysis is reached in 3 weeks or less, it is likely a Bell's palsy. A prolonged, slowly progressive, or relapsing course suggests tumor, especially if there is no recovery. Examination for middle ear disease and checking for parotid masses should be part of the evaluation.Tests may be necessary if the etiologies noted above have been ruled out. There is some evidence to show that treatment with prednisone and an antiviral agent such as valacyclovir is beneficial.",,

3270,1,Medicine,Activated charcoal is ineffective for the treatment of acute ingestions of which one of the following? ,Acetaminophen,Enteric-coated aspirin,Ferrous sulfate,Amitriptyline,Digoxin,,3,"Activated charcoal is widely used for gastrointestinal decontamination following drug overdose. There is no evidence to support or exclude its use more than 1 hour after the ingestion, however, and potential complications such as aspiration should be weighed against benefits. It is given orally or via nasogastric tube at a recommended dose of 1 g/kg body weight. Charcoal absorbs 90% of most toxins in vitro if the amount used is ten times the amount of the toxin. The charcoal-toxin complex is later evacuated in the stool. However, charged (ionized) chemicals and dissociated salts such as iron, lithium, fluoride, cyanide, mineral acids, alkalis, and some other inorganic compounds are poorly absorbed by charcoal. Even multiple-dose therapy is not effective in the treatment of poisoning due to these agents. For toxic iron ingestions useful treatments include gastric evacuation with ipecac or lavage, whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol, and chelation with deferoxamine.",,
3271,1,Medicine,"You are reviewing laboratory findings in a 64-year-old male hospitalized with acute renal failure. The patient is not on any long-term medications. His renal function has previously been normal, but currently his serum creatinine level is 2.8 mg/dL (N 0.61.5), BUN 60 mg/dL (N 825), and fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) 0.75%. His urine specific gravity is 1.025, and the urine sediment shows only hyaline casts.Based on these findings, which one of the following conditions is most likely? ",Hypervolemia,Acute pyelonephritis,Interstitial nephritis,Obstruction due to benign prostatic hypertrophy,Hypovolemia,,5,"Acute renal failure (ARF) has prerenal, renal, and postrenal causes. The approach to patients with ARF must be systematic, requiring a thorough history, medication review (including all nonprescription drugs), and careful physical examination with attention to volume status. Besides creatinine, BUN, and electrolytes, the urinalysis (including microscopic) and the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) are essential to the initial evaluation. The FENa is very useful in separating prerenal causes from renal or postrenal causes in patients who have not been on chronic diuretic therapy. A FENa 1.0%, as in this patient, indicates a prerenal cause. Of the possibilities listed, hypovolemia is the only condition that could result in prerenal ARF. Furthermore, a BUN:creatinine ratio 20, a urine specific gravity 1.020, and hyaline casts in the sediment all support the diagnosis of hypovolemia.Acute pyelonephritis may or may not result in ARF, and these patients usually have WBCs or WBC casts in the urine. Neither hypervolemia (due to fluid overload) nor benign prostatic hypertrophy would typically be associated with the laboratory findings given. Interstitial nephritis, a renal cause of ARF, would most likely result in a FENa greater than 1.0%.",,

Her examination is normal except for a slightly enlarged and tender thyroid gland. Her TSH level is 0.02 U/mL (N 0.55.5), with a higher than normal level of free T3 .Which one of the following would be the most appropriate treatment?",Levothyroxine (Synthroid),Prednisone,Propranolol (Inderal),Propylthiouracil,Radioactive iodine,,3,"This patient presents with signs, symptoms, and laboratory evidence of postpartum thyroiditis. This is an autoimmune attack of the thyroid gland that occurs in 5%10% of all mothers within a year of delivery. The transient increase of thyroid hormone that results is often unnoticed but can cause clinical hyperthyroidism. A -blocker is recommended to reduce heart irregularities and other symptoms related to high levels of circulating thyroid hormone. Propylthiouracil prevents the production of new thyroid hormone and is not indicated because this condition results only in a release of thyroid hormone that has already been created. Up to one-third of women with this condition will become chronically hypothyroid and will require regular thyroid replacement. This patient is not currently hypothyroid, so she would not benefit from replacement with levothyroxine.",,

3275,1,Medicine,"A 75-year-old male is brought to your office 1 month after a stroke that involved the left anterior cerebral artery, manifested by leg weakness, initial incontinence, and slowness in mentation. He experienced seizure activity on the second day after his stroke, but this was controlled by phenytoin (Dilantin). He has improved significantly and is now ambulatory. His family states that he now has episodic confusion, sleepiness, and clumsiness, which is preceded by paresthesias and dizziness, although no tonic-clonic activity has been noted. He remains very drowsy for several hours after these episodes. He was wearing a cardiac monitor during one episode, but it showed nothing remarkable. His phenytoin level is therapeutic, and a CBC, metabolic profile, and magnesium level are all normal.Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step? ",Discontinue the phenytoin,Add phenobarbital to the phenytoin,Begin bupropion (Wellbutrin),Begin modafinil (Provigil),Begin lamotrigine (Lamictal),,5,"Up to 50% of cases of epilepsy in the geriatric population result from cerebrovascular disease. Risk factors for post-stroke epilepsy include cortical involvement, hemorrhage, and large size. Approximately 35% of those who experience an acute stroke-related seizure develop post-stroke epilepsy, compared to only 9% of those who do not have acute seizure activity.The most common seizures in the elderly are complex partial seizures, but they do not have the typical presentation seen in younger people (aura, dj vu, olfactory hallucinations). Geriatric patients are more likely to have nonspecific preceding symptoms, such as vaguely localized paresthesias, dizziness, and muscle cramps. Those present may note episodic confusion, drowsiness, or clumsiness more than tonic-clonic movements. The postictal state is likely to be prolonged in the elderly. Misdiagnosis of these seizures is very common, with the diagnosis often delayed as much as 2 years from the time of the stroke. The most valuable diagnostic tool is a reliable history from those who witness the event.Treating seizures in the elderly by using anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) is complicated by a number of factors. Pharmacokinetics are influenced by decreases in hepatic metabolism, renal elimination, plasma proteins, and protein binding. Many elderly patients are on a multiple-medication regimen that increases the risk of drug interactions, and many AEDs are enzyme inducing, which increases the risk of osteoporosis. The elderly also are more sensitive to side effects.The choice of AEDs should be individualized, although many experts suggest early use of newer AEDs such as topiramate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, or levetiracetam because of fewer side effects and better pharmacokinetics. Monotherapy is preferred, if possible, and older drugs are less expensive, but limited by side effects.In the case described here, the patient is having breakthrough seizures despite therapeutic levels of phenytoin. Switching to lamotrigine would be preferable and is less likely to cause side effects. When transitioning from one agent to another it would be best to gradually decrease the phenytoin rather than abruptly discontinuing it. The addition of phenobarbital would further increase drowsiness. Bupropion and modafinil may actually increase seizures.",,

After initial treatment in the emergency department with intravenous fluids and insulin, laboratory tests reveal a serum phosphate level of 2.1 mg/dL (N 2.5&ndash;5.0). He is asymptomatic except for related pneumonia symptoms.Which one of the following would be appropriate management of this patient's low serum phosphate level? ",No therapy,"Oral phosphate replacement, 2.5&ndash;3.5 g/day in divided doses","Oral phosphate replacement, 2.5&ndash;3.5 g/day in divided doses, and oral vitamin D\r\nsupplementation, 400&ndash;800 IU/day","Intravenous phosphate replacement, 0.08&ndash;0.16 mmol/kg over 6 hours",,,1,"Symptomatic hypophosphatemia rarely occurs unless serum phosphate levels are below 2.0 mg/dL. Serious symptoms, including rhabdomyolysis, do not occur until serum phosphate concentrations fall below 1.0 mg/dL. Thus, treatment of hypophosphatemia with phosphate levels greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL is targeted at an underlying etiology.Hypophosphatemia in diabetic ketoacidosis cases is related to the internal redistribution of phosphate from extracellular fluid during treatment, and will resolve when normal dietary intake resumes. Phosphate supplementation in this setting has not been shown to be beneficial. Intravenous administration of phosphate can be dangerous, resulting in the precipitation of calcium and producing the adverse effects of hypocalcemia, renal failure, and possibly fatal arrhythmias.",,

Her husband, a physician, says that her symptoms resemble those of infectious mononucleosis, but he is concerned that she may have something else.Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Salmonella,Norovirus,Leptospirosis,Dengue fever,Hepatitis B,,4,"With the rising popularity of international travel to exotic locations, family physicians are encountering more febrile patients who have recently visited tropical countries. This patient has contracted dengue fever, an illness that closely resembles infectious mononucleosis, but with symptoms that usually are more severe. It is endemic in many tropical and subtropical countries, principally Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South America. The diagnosis is clinical and can be confirmed with a fourfold increase in antibody titers.

On examination you note trismus and left periorbital swelling.Which one of the following fractures is most likely? ,Zygomatic arch,Inferior orbital floor,Medial orbital floor,Basal skull,Nasal septum,,1,Fractures involving the zygomatic arch frequently cause trismus. Many of these fractures are tripod-type fractures. Dental malocclusion and temporomandibular joint pain are common. Inferior orbital fractures may be associated with numbness of the cheek if the infraorbital nerve is involved. They are also sometimes associated with limited upward gaze if the infraorbital muscle is involved. The medial orbital wall may be involved in blowout fractures. Limitation of abduction of the involved eye may result. Basal skull fractures may result in bilateral periorbital bruising or raccoon eyes. The most serious complication of nasal fractures is a nasal septal hematoma. This can cause necrosis of the septal cartilage if not promptly treated.,,

Early morning light helps regulate the circadian pattern of melatonin secretion, whereas light in the evening can delay the normal melatonin phase shift. The dosage of light therapy most often found to be effective is 5000 lux daily. This can be given as 2500 lux for 2 hours or 10,000 lux for 30 minutes. Like drug therapy for depression, light therapy does carry a risk of precipitating mania. Patients should be instructed to use light therapy units that are specifically designed for treatment of seasonal affective disorder.

3288,4,Pediatrics,A 16-year-old male comes to your office after suffering an eversion injury to his ankle while being tackled in a football game 3 days ago. He was not able to bear weight after the injury and now has tenderness at the distal tibiofibular joint with no swelling. Compression of the fibula against the tibia at the mid-calf elicits pain anterior to the lateral malleolus and proximal to the ankle joint. Stabilizing the leg and rotating the foot externally elicits pain at the same location. Radiographs are negative.Which one of the following would be most appropriate at this point? ,Application of an elastic wrap to the ankle for 2 weeks,Therapeutic ultrasound,Stress radiographs,A CT scan,Long-term semirigid support,,5,"Syndesmotic (high ankle) sprains account for as many as 11% of ankle sprains. The mechanism of injury is dorsiflexion and/or eversion of the ankle, most commonly in contact sports. The syndesmotic structures include the anterior, posterior, and transverse tibiofibular ligaments, as well as the interosseous membrane. These injuries can cause chronic ankle instability, resulting in recurrent sprains and hypertrophic ossification.The diagnosis can be made by several tests. The squeeze test can be performed by compressing the fibula against the tibia at mid-calf. A positive test occurs when this elicits pain in the region of the anterior tibiofibular ligament. A positive external rotation stress test causes pain at the same site. It is performed by stabilizing the leg and externally rotating the foot. The crossed-leg test can also detect this injury. The patient places the involved ankle on the opposite knee and pressure is applied to the medial side of the involved ankle, which causes pain at the syndesmosis.While ankle support is often useful for less serious sprains, a Cochrane review showed that semirigid supports are better than elastic bandages. Therapeutic ultrasound has not been shown to have any value for ankle sprains. The injury can be confirmed with an MRI. Indications for referral to an orthopedic surgeon include fracture, dislocation or subluxation, syndesmotic injury, tendon rupture, and uncertain diagnosis.",,

On examination, the shoulder appears normal and there is no pain with external rotation of the shoulder, bringing the arm across the body (scarf test), or attempted external and internal rotation of the shoulder against resistance. Lowering the arm from full abduction (painful arc), attempted abduction above 45 against resistance, and elevating the internally rotated arm above 90 against resistance are all painful.The most likely diagnosis is: ",subdeltoid bursitis,adhesive capsulitis,impingement syndrome,glenohumeral osteoarthritis,acromioclavicular osteoarthritis,,3,"The combination of a painful arc and pain on use of the supraspinatus muscle indicates impingement syndrome, which is due to irritation of the rotator cuff under the coracoacromial arch. It is by far the most common cause of shoulder pain seen by family physicians. Subdeltoid bursitis is a much more acute problem, and impairs shoulder mobility in all directions. Adhesive capsulitis produces loss of external rotation. Glenohumeral arthritis produces pain with external rotation, and variable amounts of impaired mobility, depending on progression of the problem over time. Acromioclavicular joint arthritis produces a positive scarf sign, and often a visible bump over the joint, since it lies so close to the skin surface.",,

It is crucial to make the diagnosis early, so screening during infancy and childhood is necessary. Early screening results in better outcomes. However, studies suggest that only 20% of school-age children are routinely screened.Congenital cataracts, ptosis, and corneal lesions are less common causes of amblyopia, which act by deprivation of visual information.

The IOM expert committee reviewed a number of health outcomes that could potentially be related to calcium and vitamin D, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and immunity, and found that the evidence was inconsistent and did not demonstrate a cause-and-effect relationship.  Consequently, these health outcomes could not be used for the purposes of determining nutrient requirements. The IOM report states that there are no additional health benefits associated with vitamin D intakes above the level of the new RDA.Health Canada recommends that, in addition to following Canada's Food Guide, everyone over the age of 50 should take a daily vitamin D supplement of 400 IU.The DRIs for calcium are based on evidence related to bone health, largely from the results of calcium balance studies. Calcium balance, which can be positive, neutral or negative, compares total calcium intake with urinary and fecal excretion of calcium.

Shortly after admission she begins to experience profound orthostatic hypotension and gastrointestinal distress. Serial hemoglobin tests are stable, but serum sodium and bicarbonate levels are low. Her potassium level is slightly elevated.Which one of the following tests would most quickly determine if she has suffered from acute adrenal cortex insufficiency (Addison's disease)? ",A cosyntropin stimulation test,A dexamethasone suppression test,A renin:aldosterone ratio,A serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level,Measurement of 24-hour urinary excretion of catecholamines,,1,"Destruction of the adrenal cortex by acute causes (infarction, hemorrhage, infection) or chronic ones (granulomatous disease, immune destruction) results in a loss of circulating levels of cortisol and aldosterone. The effects of this deficiency can include electrolyte disturbances such as those seen in this patient, gastrointestinal distress (including &ldquo;acute abdomen,&rdquo; diarrhea, nausea, etc.), orthostatic hypotension, and patient fatigue. If the process is gradual, ACTH levels will increase, resulting in a darkened skin tone. Measuring serum levels of ACTH may be helpful in determining the cause of decreased cortisol levels, but is not a good first test of adrenal cortex function. The dexamethasone suppresion test is used to evaluate glucocorticoid excess.The cosyntropin stimulation test does assess adrenal cortex function. This test involves injecting cosyntropin, 250 &micro;g intramuscularly or intravenously, and measuring cortisol levels 60 minutes later. If the result shows an inadequate response (cortisol level &lt;495 nmol/L), adrenal cortical function is proven to be at least 90% diminished.",,

",Screening is strongly recommended for all preschool children because good evidence\r\nexists for substantial benefit over harm,Screening is not recommended because it is ineffective,Screening is not recommended because the potential harm outweighs the potential\r\nbenefits,The evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against routine screening,,,4,"Speech and language delay affects 5%&ndash;8% of preschool children. It often continues into the school years and may be connected to poor school performance and psychosocial problems. In reviewing the data, the Canadian Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence that brief, formal screening instruments that are suitable for use in primary care for assessing speech and language development can accurately identify children who would benefit from further evaluation and intervention. Therefore, the Task Force makes an &ldquo;I&rdquo; recommendation&mdash;the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against routinely providing the service.Fair evidence suggests that interventions can improve the results of short-term assessments of speech and language skills; however, no studies have assessed long-term outcomes. Furthermore, no studies have addressed benefits from the use of brief, formal screening compared to addressing only those problems identified from clinical or parental concerns. No studies have addressed the potential harms of screening or interventions for speech and language delays, such as labeling, parental anxiety, or unnecessary evaluation and intervention.The guidelines presented are based on the best available evidence at the time they are written. In cases where the evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against an intervention, physicians should base clinical decisions on the individual patient's situation.",,

Cryotherapy and curettage with electrodesiccation are recommended as primary treatments, but would not be appropriate in this case because lesions on the central part of the face are at risk for extensive subclinical spread.",,
3306,1,Medicine,Chest pain associated with cocaine use: ,should be treated with -blockers,has an onset that has a consistent relationship with time of use,is associated with characteristic EKG changes,is mainly vasospastic in origin,,,4,"While chest pain related to cocaine use and withdrawal may be due to atherosclerosis, the main mechanism is believed to be a dopamine-depleted state, resulting in coronary vasospasm. This vasospasm can occur at even low doses. Coronary artery vasospasm is exacerbated by -blockade, and is likely mediated through alpha-adrenergic receptors. Therefore, -blockers are contraindicated for patients with chest pain associated with cocaine use, because of concerns about unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation worsening coronary and peripheral vasoconstriction, and hypertension. The temporal relationship of cocaine use to the onset of chest pain is highly variable, which may indicate a chronic abnormality predisposing to myocardial ischemia. The EKG abnormalities are variable. A significant number of patients with cocaine-associated chest pain have evidence of persistent ST-segment elevation rather than the transient changes typical of coronary artery spasm.",,

Although testing from other sites is usually reliable, it can be inaccurate if performed within 60 minutes of meals or after exercise. If a patient's random blood glucose level is less than 100 mg/dL, a small snack should be eaten. Preprandial results should be 90&ndash;130 mg/dL, and postprandial levels should be &lt;180 mg/dL.

Amenorrhea and irregular bleeding are the most common adverse effects of DMPA. Other side effects include irritability, depression, weight gain, hair loss, and acne. Acne and other skin problems are related to the drug's androgenicity. DMPA is associated with an increase in bone resorption and a significant reduction in bone mineral density, presumably due to the induction of estrogen deficiency. In women of normal weight, DMPA has been shown to cause no statistically significant change in weight; however, in obese adolescents using DMPA there is an increased likelihood of weight gain compared to oral contraceptives and nonhormonal contraception.",,
3309,1,Medicine,"A 65-year-old female presents with a complaint of slowly increasing discomfort in her knees of 3 years' duration. An examination and radiograph are consistent with noninflammatory osteoarthritis. She says that the pain is well-controlled with acetaminophen, but she wants to know what can be done to prevent further damage to the joint.You recommend: ",referral to a rheumatologist for disease-modifying agents such as methotrexate,hyaluranon injections to preserve cartilage,corticosteroid injections,symptomatic measures only,,,4,"Osteoarthritis is a common finding in older people; some studies show that 25% of patients over age 65 have osteoarthritic changes. Unfortunately, no pharmacologic treatments have been found to prevent the progression of joint destruction. Maintaining ideal weight and avoiding excessive use of the knees, including deep knee bends, running, and stair climbing, does lessen destructive forces on the joint. A reasonable walking program can improve both pain and joint function.Acetaminophen is the first choice for joint pain in someone with noninflammatory osteoarthritis. NSAIDs provide better pain relief but can cause renal damage, fluid retention, and GI bleeding, and are therefore reserved as a second-line treatment. Narcotics usually are reserved for short-term use during flares of arthritis. Studies show that injections of corticosteroids or hyaluranons improve symptoms for some, but have not been shown to lessen joint destruction. Disease-modifying agents, such as methotrexate, can help inflammatory arthritic joints, as in psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, but have not been shown to be of benefit in osteoarthritis.",,

This adjustment must be made early in pregnancy because normal fetal brain development in the first 12 weeks of gestation depends upon maternal thyroxine as its source of thyroid hormone. There is strong circumstantial evidence that a deficiency of maternal T4 in the first trimester is associated with lower IQs in the offspring.Concurrent iron supplementation will interfere with T4 absorption and should be given at separate times.,,

The pregnancy was uneventful, with an uncomplicated labor and delivery at 38 weeks gestation. The mother's blood type is A, Rh-positive. The birth weight was 3000 g (6 lb 10 oz) and the current weight is also 3000 g. You note that the baby is jaundiced, but the examination is otherwise unremarkable. Her total bilirubin level is 16 mg/dL with an indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin level of 14.5 mg/dL. Further testing shows a hemoglobin level of 20 g/dL (N 14.5&ndash;22.5), a normal reticulocyte count for age, and a negative Coombs test. Which one of the following is most likely causing the baby's jaundice? ",Breastfeeding,Spherocytosis,Rh incompatibility,Biliary atresia,Neonatal sepsis,,1,"Breastfeeding is the most likely cause of this baby's jaundice. It usually appears within the first week of life, when breastfed infants have higher bilirubin levels than do formula-fed infants. Hyperbilirubinemia (&gt;12 mg/dL) develops in 13% of breastfed infants and may be due to the dehydration or reduced caloric intake associated with reduced mild intake. Giving supplemental glucose water to breastfed infants is associated with higher bilirubin levels, in part because of reduced intake of breast milk, which has a higher caloric density. Frequent breastfeeding (&gt;10/24 hr), rooming-in with night feeding, and discouraging 5% dextrose or water supplementation may reduce the incidence of early breastfeeding jaundice.With spherocytosis, the predominant bilirubin is indirect (unconjugated), but the hemoglobin is low and the reticulocyte count is increased, with spherocytes seen on the blood smear. Isoimmunization occurs with an Rh-negative mother and an Rh-positive child. There is a positive Coombs test with this condition. The predominant bilirubin in biliary atresia and neonatal sepsis is the direct (conjugated) type. In addition, it is unlikely that a baby with neonatal sepsis would be maintaining weight and have no abnormalities other than jaundice on physical examination.",,

",Watchful waiting,Karyotype analysis,Ultrasonography of the uterus,A progestogen challenge test,Pregnancy test,,1,"Primary amenorrhea is diagnosed if menarche has not occurred by 16 years of age. Because this patient had no secondary sexual characteristics, her FSH and LH levels were measured. The fact that both are low indicates hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. The most common cause for this situation in girls with primary amenorrhea is constitutional delay of growth and puberty. A detailed family history might help confirm this etiology, because it is often familial. Watchful waiting is appropriate for this problem.-Karyotype analysis would be the next step in diagnosis if FSH and LH were elevated, indicating hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, which could be associated with 46,XX and premature ovarian failure, or 45,XO and Turner's syndrome. -Ultrasonography would be appropriate if secondary sexual characteristics were present and would identify whether the uterus is absent or abnormal, and whether an outflow obstruction exists. -The hormone challenge tests and pregnancy test are used to evaluate secondary amenorrhea.",,

3324,1,Medicine,Which one of the following is associated with a group A -streptococcal infection? ,Guttate psoriasis,Lichen planus,Pityriasis rosea,Bullous impetigo,Roseola,,1,"In guttate psoriasis there is an acute onset of small, widely scattered, uniform lesions, often following a streptococcal infection. Bullous impetigo is caused by a dermatologic toxin produced at the site of an infection with Staphylococcus aureus. Exanthem subitum (roseola, sixth disease) is caused by human herpesvirus 6. Lichen planus is a papulosquamous disorder with an unknown etiology, but cutaneous eruptions clinically resembling lichen planus have been observed after administration of numerous drugs, including diuretics, gold, antimalarials, penicillamine, and phenothiazines, and in patients with skin lesions of chronic graft-versus-host-disease. Additionally, lichen planus associated with abnormal liver function has been correlated with viral hepatitis, particularly hepatitis C infection. Pityriasis rosea is a papulosquamous eruption of unknown etiology that occurs more commonly in the spring and fall. Its first manifestation is the development of a 2- to 6-cm annular lesion (the herald patch). There is some evidence that it has a viral origin.",,

The use of long-term high doses of postmenopausal estrogen carries an estimated risk of 1020. Living in North America or Europe also has an estimated risk of 1020.A lower relative risk is associated with nulliparity, obesity, infertility, late menopause, older age, and white race. The relative risk associated with these factors falls into the range of 25. Early menarche, higher education or income levels, menstrual irregularities, and a history of diabetes, hypertension, gall bladder disease, or thyroid disease have a relative risk of around 1.52.0.The relative risk associated with cigarette smoking is 0.5, and for long-term use of high-dose oral contraceptives it is 0.30.5.",,

He has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes a day for the past 40 years.The best diagnostic test for evaluating this problem is: ",arterial blood gases,alpha1-antitrypsin,brain natriuretic peptide (BNP),CT of the chest,spirometry,,5,"In patients with suspected COPD, the best diagnostic test is office spirometry. If the FEV1/FVC ratio is 70% and the FEV1 is 80% of predicted, the patient has COPD. This generally occurs in mid- to late life. While cigarette smoking is the largest single risk factor, only 20% of smokers develop clinically significant COPD. The second most common risk factor is alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, which causes 1% of cases. These patients present with cough, sputum production, and dyspnea on exertion. They often experience orthopnea soon after reclining, whereas patients with heart failure typically experience orthopnea several hours after reclining, when fluid mobilizes from the lower extremities.",,
3334,1,Medicine,Which one of the following would be appropriate for pain control in a critically ill patient in the intensive-care unit? ,Meperidine (Demerol),Ketorolac (Toradol),Butorphanol (Stadol),Hydromorphone (Dilaudid),Methadone (Dolophine),,4,"Hydromorphone, morphine sulfate, and fentanyl are the three most commonly used opioid analgesics for pain control in the intensive-care unit (ICU). The other drugs listed are considered inappropriate for analgesia in the ICU. Meperidine is not recommended because its analgesia is not superior to that of morphine. Also, its metabolite normeperidine is eliminated through the kidneys and has neurotoxic effects, including seizures and delirium. NSAIDs such as ketorolac are not recommended, because they are not superior to opiates. In addition, they cause platelet inhibition and have an antiprostaglandin effect that increases the risk of stress ulcers and renal injury.Opiate agonist-antagonists such as butorphanol may precipitate withdrawal in chronic opiate users or in ICU patients who have received opiates for a prolonged period of time. They also may reverse opiate analgesic effects. Methadone has an extended duration of activity that increases the risk of accumulation and adverse effects with repeated dosing.",,

",Monocular visual loss,Internuclear ophthalmoplegia,Headache,Motor weakness,Apraxia of gait,,5,"Gait instability (sometimes referred to as apraxia of gait), urinary incontinence, and dementia are typical signs and symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). A decrease in the absorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results in ventricular enlargement, but no significant increase in CSF pressure. Although it accounts for less than 5% of dementia cases, it is important to recognize NPH because it may be effectively treated by shunting in some patients. Monocular visual loss and headache are symptoms of benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), and internuclear ophthalmoplegia is a sign of multiple sclerosis. Motor weakness is not a sign of NPH.",,

The most effective way to screen for thyroid dysfunction is to order a TSH level with third-generation assays using an immunoradiometric assay (IRMA). The RAST test is used for allergy testing. Notably, the College of Physicians recommends periodic screening only for women age 50 and older. Other organizations have varying guidelines.",,

She has no other medical complaints.Testing to exclude which one of the following is most important before starting latent TB therapy with isoniazid (INH)? ",Active TB,Previous hepatitis,Diabetes mellitus,Neuropathy,Pregnancy,,1,"It is essential to exclude active tuberculosis infection through a screening chest radiograph before instituting therapy for latent tuberculosis. Failure to do so increases the risk of developing drug resistance. Patients who have had hepatitis in the past require monitoring of liver function but can usually be treated. Diabetics, who have a higher risk of developing tuberculosis, should be treated. Pyridoxine (vitamin B) is often given to patients with neuropathy. Pregnancy is not a contraindication for INH prophylaxis when there is documentation of a valid indication such as conversion to a positive PPD within the past 2 years. In addition to INH, pregnant patients should be treated with pyridoxine. In otherwise healthy individuals, pyridoxine supplementation is unnecessary.",,

You suspect patellofemoral pain syndrome.Which one of the following would be most consistent with this diagnosis? ,Pain with prolonged sitting,Swelling,Locking,Giving way,,,1,"Patellofemoral pain syndrome causes nonfocal or anterior knee pain, and is often seen in runners. Common symptoms include stiffness, pain with prolonged sitting, and pain with climbing or descending stairs. Rarely is there swelling, locking, or giving way; these symptoms are more likely to be associated with more profound problems such as a ligament or cartilage tear.",,
3344,4,Pediatrics,"A 3-year-old white male is brought to your office because of coughing, drooling, chest pain on swallowing, and refusing food for the last 2 days. Other than irritability and clutching his hand to his chest, you find no abnormalities on physical examination. A radiograph of the chest shows what appears to be a coin in the area of the lower esophagus.Which one of the following treatments is most appropriate at this time? ",Watchful waiting,Administering glucagon to advance the foreign body into the stomach,Endoscopic removal of the foreign body,Use of an inflated Foley catheter with radiocontrast dye under fluoroscopy to remove\r\nthe foreign body,Use of bougienage to force the foreign body into the stomach,,3,"This child ingested a coin without the parent's knowledge (about 40% of foreign body ingestions in children are not witnessed) and has symptoms suggesting esophageal obstruction. Coins are the most common objects ingested by children in Canada. Most blunt objects in the esophagus may be observed up to 24 hours. If a single coin has been lodged in the esophagus for less than 24 hours in a child with no respiratory distress and no prior foreign body ingestion, Foley catheter or bougienage techniques may be tried.For the Foley technique, a Foley catheter is passed beyond the coin and the balloon is inflated with radiocontrast dye, and then is pulled out under fluoroscopy. The potential for airway compromise has prevented this technique from becoming universally accepted. Bougienage seems to be safe, is less costly, and does not require anesthesia. Bougienage is used to push the coin into the stomach, where it should pass spontaneously. In some patients, however, pushing the coin into the stomach may result in an obstruction that requires endoscopic or surgical removal. Objects lodged in the esophagus for more than 24 hours should be removed endoscopically. If the object has been lodged in the esophagus for more than 2 weeks there is a significant risk of erosion into surrounding structures, and surgical consultation should be obtained.",,
3345,1,Medicine,Which one of the following is the best initial screening test for hemochromatosis?,Total iron binding capacity,Hemoglobin electrophoresis,Serum iron concentration,Serum ferritin concentration,Serum transferrin saturation,,5,"The diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis is based on a combination of clinical, laboratory, and pathologic criteria, including elevated serum transferrin saturation and elevated serum ferritin concentration. Elevated serum transferrin saturation is the earliest phenotypic abnormality. While this is the best initial screening test, results may be normal early in the course of the disease. In addition, because serum iron concentrations vary throughout the day and measurements may be affected by the ingestion of food, a test showing elevated serum transferrin saturation should be repeated as a fasting early-morning determination. Furthermore, the serum ferritin concentration and serum transferrin saturation may be elevated in 30%50% of patients with acute or chronic viral hepatitis or alcoholic liver disease.Serum ferritin concentration is a sensitive measure of iron overload, but it is also an acute-phase reactant and is therefore elevated in a variety of infectious and inflammatory conditions in the absence of iron overload. Consequently, it should not be used as the initial screening test to detect hereditary hemochromatosis.",,

Often there is a combination of two or three of these conditions. If the rotator cuff tear is small, treatment is similar to that recommended for the other conditions. However, if a significant rupture has occurred, immobilization and/or surgical consultation is appropriate. On physical examination, a painful arc of abduction above 90 and weakness in external rotation would be expected with a torn rotator cuff. Of these two, weakness in external rotation is much more specific.",,

There is no evidence that one is superior to the others. Hypokalemia and hyperthyroidism can cause SVT, but there is no association with hyperparathyroid disease or hyponatremia. Carotid sinus massage and adenosine have been used for diagnosing atrial tachycardia. (Adenosine is an ultrashort-acting drug that is useful in SVTs of unknown origin both in making the diagnosis and in terminating those that are dependent on the AV junction and some focal atrial tachycardia.)Excessive alcohol use can precipitate SVT.",,

",Abdominal ultrasonography with Doppler,CT with contrast,MRI of the abdomen,Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the abdomen,Positron emission tomography (PET) of the abdomen,,1,"Ultrasonography with Doppler should be the first imaging study ordered in the evaluation of suspected liver disease. It is widely available, relatively inexpensive, involves no radiation or contrast exposure, and provides helpful information regarding the appearance of the liver and blood flow in the portal and hepatic veins. If hepatic nodules are found on ultrasonography, CT is indicated to help differentiate between benign and malignant lesions. MRI is best used as a follow-up study to determine whether lesions have changed in appearance or size. MRA can detect portal hypertension, portal flow volume and direction, and portal vein thrombosis. PET scans can detect the presence of liver metastases from certain cancers, but are not used as an initial test for evaluating liver disease.",,

Often the plain posterior-anterior wrist radiograph is normal. However, a special view with the wrist prone in ulnar deviation elongates the scaphoid, often demonstrating subtle navicular fractures. Hook of the hamate fractures cause tenderness at the proximal hypothenar area 1 cm distal to the flexion crease of the wrist. When this fracture is suspected, carpal tunnel and supinated oblique view radiographs should be obtained. A scapholunate dislocation can be identified with a clenched-fist view and the supinated view in ulnar deviation.",,
3353,1,Medicine,Which one of the following is shown in the EKG?,Atrial fibrillation,Atrial flutter,Multifocal atrial tachycardia,Complete AV block,Normal sinus rhythm,i239.jpg,5,"Baseline artifact from tremors, body shakes, etc., can be confused with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Normal EKGs should have a normal P wave before each QRS. The rate and QRS complex should be normal unless sinus tachycardia is present.Atrial fibrillation (AF) is characterized by disorganized atrial activity without discrete P waves. Ventricular response is irregularly irregular. A slow, regular rate in a patient with AF suggests a manifestation of digitalis toxicity.Atrial flutter is characterized by an atrial rate of 250350 beats/min. Typically the ventricular rate is one-half of the atrial rate. Classically, atrial flutter waves are seen as regular saw-tooth-like atrial activity, most prominent in the inferior leads. When the ventricular rate is regular and not a simple fraction of the atrial rate, complete heart block should be suspected, which may be a manifestation of digitalis toxicity.Multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT) requires three or more consecutive P waves of different morphologies at a rate of 100 beats/min. There may be an irregular ventricular rate. This is common in digitalis toxicity, hypokalemia, and severe cardiac and pulmonary diseases, or with certain drugs (theophylline or adrenergic drugs).Complete AV block would have a significantly slower ventricular rate, and P waves would occur at irregular intervals.",,

Which of the following would be the most appropriate first step for intervention?",Confront the patient about his smoking behavior and associated health risks,Educate the patient about physiological and psychosocial therapies available for smoking cessation,Establish a therapeutic alliance with the patient,Make a referral to a psychiatrist for nicotine dependence,Give the patient pamphlets on smoking cessation,,3,"Establishing a therapeutic relationship is important due to the chronic, relapsing nature of nicotine dependence. Advising a patient to stop smoking is best done in a supportive and non-judgmental manner. There are currently no studies to support that confrontational styles are effective for smoking cessation. Often smokers are ambivalent about quitting, and giving more personalized information and feedback on smoking cessation can increase motivation to change.",,

3391,5,Psychiatry,Psychiatric symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis include each of the following EXCEPT:,Depression,Mania,Compulsions,Reduced information processing,Memory impairment,,3,"Compulsions are not particularly associated with MS. Depression is the most common psychiatric symptom associated with this population, with a lifetime prevalence of 40-50%. Suicide risk is also elevated. The coexistance of mania and MS is as high as 13 times what would be expected in a normal population. Steroid therapy may precipitate manic episodes, but there is evidence that underlying organic changes in the brain play a role. Cognitive deficits such as memory impairment, slowed information processing, and concentration problems become present in 60-70% of MS patients.",,
3392,5,Psychiatry,Fragile X syndrome is associated with each of the following characteristics EXCEPT:,More common in females,Most common form of inherited mental retardation,Involves the long arm of the X chromosome,Can be diagnosed with a blood test,Treatment is limited to symptomatic management,,1,"Fragile X syndrome is more common in males than females, affecting 1 in 2000 and 1 in 4000, respectively. It is the most common inherited form of mental retardation and second only to Down's syndrome as a cause of mental impairment. As the name implies, the syndrome is the result of a fragile site on the long arm of the X chromosome attributed to the excess amplification of the trinucleotide CGG sequence. It is thought that the protein produced by this gene is responsible for guiding the connections between neurons involved in learning and memory. The symptoms of this pervasive developmental disorder include mental retardation ranging from learning disabilities to severe intellectual impairment, hyperactivity, unstable mood, and autistic-like behaviors. The diagnosis can now be made by a DNA probe to pinpoint the defective gene. Presently gene repair is not possible, so treatments include behavioral and pharmacologic management of the symptoms.",,
3393,5,Psychiatry,Which of the following statements regarding clinical depression is TRUE?,The age of onset has become later in life over the past several decades,The overall rate of depression has decreased in the U.S.,The DSM-IV diagnostic criteria include a six-week duration of the symptoms,A relative lack of dietary W-3 fatty acids has been associated with this condition,This condition is equally common in males and females,,4,"Over the past century, the sharp increase in the dietary intake of W-6 (omega) fatty acids and a rapid decline of dietary W-3 (omega) fatty acids has paralleled the increased rate of depression in the U.S. Interestingly there has been a progressive earlier age of onset, as well, while the condition remains more prevalent in women compared to men. DSM-IV diagnostic criteria include a depressed mood or decreased interest for at least two weeks with the associated symptoms of sleep and appetite changes, energy disturbance, guilt, poor concentration, and suicidal ideation. Clinical depression is thought to affect 11 million Americans yearly.",,
3394,5,Psychiatry,A 43-year-old female secretary is followed by her psychiatrist for recurrent annual depressive episodes. She recently watched a special on the local public television channel about seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and is inquiring what causes this condition. The correct response would include each of the following EXCEPT:,There are many theories regarding the causes of SAD,Melatonin may be involved,Serotonin may be involved,Diminished appetite seen in winter SAD suggests an endocrine problem,SAD is more common in the northern latitudes,,4,"Diminished appetite is not typical of SAD. In fact, carbohydrate craving is common for winter SAD. The theories regarding SAD are numerous, emanating from observation, clinical research, and patient intuition. The incidence of pure SAD is much higher in the northern latitudes, resulting in an interest in the seasonal variations of sunlight exposure and temperature as possible causes. The administration of melatonin can cause relapses in patients with SAD. The most accepted theory as to the etiology of SAD involves serotonin. The more common successful treatments for SAD affect serotonin in some way. These include the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and light therapy.",,
3395,5,Psychiatry,"A 34-year-old woman presents to her obstetrician's office accompanied by her spouse three weeks after delivering a healthy infant son. Her husband relates that soon after leaving the hospital his wife has become increasingly irritable, tearful, and is having trouble sleeping. The past week she has become extremely indecisive and expresses concerns that she is not capable of caring for her newborn even though this is her third child. Which one of the following is the likely diagnosis?",Postpartum blues,Puerpal psychosis,Postpartum major depression,Adjustment disorder with mixed emotional features,Bipolar disorder,,3,"The postpartum period is a time of increased risk for development of mood disturbances in women. Postpartum depressive disorders are divided into three classifications: postpartum blues, postpartum depression, and puerperal psychosis. Postpartum blues symptoms peak on the fourth or fifth day after delivery and last for several days, but they are generally time-limited and spontaneously remit within the first 10 days to 2 postpartum weeks.Postpartum or puerperal psychosis is relatively rare, with the onset for the majority of cases within 2 weeks postpartum. Psychotic symptoms would include delusions, hallucinations, and bizarre, disorganized behavior. There is an association between postpartum psychosis and bipolar disorder. This patient's symptoms are too severe to classify as an adjustment disorder. Her mood disturbance warrants psychiatric consultation and likely will require pharmacologic treatment.",,
3396,5,Psychiatry,Risk factors associated with the development of postpartum affective disorders include each of the following EXCEPT:,History of mood disorder,Higher socioeconomic status,Complicated pregnancy,Thyroid dysfunction,Difficult delivery,,2,"Higher socioeconomic status. Actually, a lower socioeconomic status with antecedent chronic stress, inadequate social supports, limited funds for basic needs such as food, formula, shelter, etc. is a risk factor for postpartum mood disorders. Women with a history of postpartum affective disturbances have a recurrence rate as high as 50% in some studies. For this population, medical and psychologic prevention prior to delivery is very important. In some cases, prophylactic antidepressants or mood stabilizing agents are warranted. Thyroid dysfunction itself can cause a mood disorder, and certainly a complicated delivery can be traumatic psychologically.",,
3397,5,Psychiatry,"A 30-year-old man presents with the typical findings of depression and is started on an antidepressant medication. At the time of presentation he was having suicidal thoughts, but he had no plan to act on them and felt hopeful about improving with medication. He sees you in your office for a follow-up visit the following week and reports improvement in appetite, sleep, and concentration. He reports having more energy to get up and go to work in the mornings. He still has suicidal thoughts, but they are much less frequent. He still feels he won't act on them. One week later the patient commits suicide. What is the most likely reason that this patient committed suicide after getting treatment?",Antidepressant medications can cause some patients to act on suicidal thoughts,The patient has overly stressed by his work and should have been given a work release,Patients are at highest risk for suicide when they begin to regain their energy,Patients frequently feel more hopeless after seeing a psychiatrist and will overdose on the medications they are given,None of the above,,3,"In a severe depression there is characteristically a loss of drive, concentration, and energy to carry out any plans. As these factors improve, it become possible that the patient will develop and carry out a plan for suicide.A. This is a misperception because of the effect that they have on improving the patients' vegetative symptoms.B. That is not necessarily so, since some patients do better if they are distracted and still involved in their normal activities.D. Patients frequently report more hope after seeing a psychiatrist, which is part of the placebo response seen in antidepressant medications and therapy. ",,
3398,5,Psychiatry,"A patient that you are starting on valproic acid has a history of elevated ammonia levels in the past when taking this medication. There are no other options at this point in her treatment, so you make the following recommendation:",Follow liver function tests every 2 weeks,Place the patient on a stimulant if symptoms return,Start lactulose to prevent an elevated ammonia level this time,Start carnitine to prevent an elevated ammonia level this time,None of the above,,4,"The mechanism that leads to elevated ammonia levels in patients taking valproic acid is based on a depletion of the vitamin carnitine which is required in fatty acid transport. If carnitine is depleted by valproic acid, it can disrupt this process, which results in ammonia formation. Some patients can prevent this from occurring by taking carnitine as a supplement. Unfortunately, it does not reverse the process for everyone. Of note, the degree of ammonia elevation is not an accurate indicator of expected severity of symptoms.A. The liver function tests are not indicators of this specific problem.B. This is the not the treatment for high ammonia levels.C. Lactulose decreases ammonia levels in alcoholics by increasing transit time in the bowel, which reduces the amount of ammonia that is transported across the bowel wall to the serum. This is minimally helpful in patients with valproic acid induced elevations in ammonia. ",,

Her medications include a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, phenelzine, which she has taken for many years. Shortly after receiving the analgesic she becomes nauseated, diaphoretic, and her blood pressure increases to 190/110. What analgesic was responsible for this reaction?",Meperidine,Ibuprofen,Morphine,Codeine,Acetaminophen,,1,"Meperidine (Demerol) is contraindicated in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors. It can result in a serotonin syndrome that can include severe hypertensive crisis, occipital headache, stiff neck, sweating, nausea, restlessness, muscle twitches, seizures, and high fever. Morphine and codeine in high doses or in a patient on other potentiating medications could lead to this syndrome as well, but meperidine is the most likely culprit.",,
3400,5,Psychiatry,Each of the following is associated with conversion disorder EXCEPT:,Extreme concern by the patient for the disability,Not intentionally produced,Higher incidence in women,Frequent history of sexual abuse,Symptoms end abruptly,,1,"Many conversion disorder patients exhibit la belle indifference, a lack of concern regarding an apparent extreme decline in their health. This condition often presents in late adolescence or early adulthood and is more common in women with histrionic personality disorder and past history of sexual abuse during childhood. In contrast to malingering or factitious disorder, the symptoms of a conversion disorder are not intentionally produced, but rather the ego defense mechanisms of repression and dissociation are unconsciously at work. The symptoms generally begin suddenly following a period of psychological stress and in most cases end abruptly and are of a short duration. ",,
3401,5,Psychiatry,"An 18-year-old female presents with a fear of having run over someone when she is driving. She has had to stop her car and get out to see if there is a body in the road every time she drives over a bump. When you ask her about other worries, she states she checks her stove, iron, and coffee pot multiple times a day to ensure they are turned off. She has tried to stop doing these things because she feels they don't make sense, but feels intense anxiety if she doesn't stop and check. The medications used to treat this disorder work primarily through which neurotransmitter?",GABA,Serotonin,Glutamate,Norepinephrine,None of the above,,2,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder is thought to occur due to serotonin dysregulation. The areas of the brain that are thought to be involved are the frontal lobes, the basal ganglia, and the cingulum.

She asks you to prescribe disulfiram for her because she has met many people in A.A. who have stayed sober after using it. In reviewing the side effects with her you explain that if she ingests any alcohol she may experience flushing, tachycardia, nausea, diaphoresis, or severe anxiety. These symptoms occur because disulfiram causes:",An accumulation of acetaldehyde,A sudden increase in the release of endogenous opioids,A sudden decrease in serotonin levels resulting in a panic attack,None of the above,,,1,"The fear of the unpleasant symptoms of disulfiram is used as a deterrent to future drinking in those patients who are willing to take the medication. It works by causing a shift in the chemical reaction involved in metabolizing alcohol in the liver. The result is a shift toward the production of acetaldehyde. Severe reactions can occur if a patient drinks despite taking her disulfiram. In those cases an alternative method must be used.The toxic effects of disulfiram are not a result of serotonin level changes.An alternative agent to disulfiram is naltrexone, an opiate antagonist, which works by decreasing cravings and rates of relapse.Though the sensation after ingesting alcohol is described like a panic attack, the mechanism of action of disulfiram is not thought to be through serotonin pathways.

Small amounts have resulted in hyperthermia and near death. This drug can cause a serotonin-like syndrome requiring rapid cooling of the body. The associated dancing in a warm environment at a rave party can result in severe electrolyte imbalance as well. Frequent users may develop tolerance to the pleasant or euphoric effects of MMDA. Other drugs may be added to produce or augment the psychotropic effect being sought.",,
3405,5,Psychiatry,Each of the following statements about tobacco use is true EXCEPT:,55% of the population experiment with tobacco,The mesolimbic system is involved in the reinforcing effects of nicotine,30% of smokers succeed in quitting smoking,Smoking is more common among depressed patients,Genetic influences predispose to smoking persistence,,3,Only 2-3% of dependent smokers succeed in quitting smoking. Tobacco use for many is a classical addictive disorder with the behavior pattern of compulsive drug use despite adverse psychosocial and health consequences. Dopamine is the key neurotransmitter of the mesolimbic system reinforced by nicotine stimulation. Some research suggests that the effects of nicotine may have similar results to antidepressants. This may explain the shared benefit of cessation. Both genetic and environmental factors are important to develop regular tobacco use. Those who persist smoking have a .70 genetic predisposition.,,

Persistent use despite psychological and physical impairment as well as developing tolerance are hallmarks of such. The delirium seen with cannabis is similar to what is seen with the hallucinogens and psychomimetics and can last up to 10 days. Decreased libido, ataxia, increased reaction time, perceptual distortion, and restlessness are also associated with cannabis usage. Anxiety is common during acute intoxication, especially for inexperienced users, and is often provoked by paranoid thoughts. Although there are approximately 60 active substances in cannabis, THC is thought to be the key chemical responsible for the psychoactive effect.",,

REM sleep (darkened area) occurs cyclically through the night, and stages 3 and 4 (slow wave sleep) are concentrated earlier during sleep. Alzheimer's disease is typically marked by frequent interruptions in sleep throughout the night. Parkinson's disease is plagued by an increased number of awakenings throughout the night, as well, with decreased REM sleep.

After further medical history is obtained and a physical exam is done there is no obvious medication explanation for his symptoms. The most likely diagnosis is:",Major depressive disorder,Truancy,School phobia,Antisocial personality disorder,Conduct disorder,,3,"School phobia is characterized by symptoms being most severe in the morning while getting ready for school. Typically the child's somatic symptoms and feelings of distress are most severe after a long weekend away from school, and they tend to reduce as the child progresses through their day at school. It is necessary to determine if there is a justified fear such as the child being bullied or teased. If no medical or situational explanation is found, it is important to keep the child attending school as much as possible. If the child faces the anxiety consistently, it will likely extinguish and the school phobia will resolve.A. Depression may lead to a school avoidance over time, but other symptoms of depression should be present throughout the day and on weekends.B. Truant children will readily leave the home claiming they are going to school.D. Antisocial personality disorder cannot be diagnosed before the age of 18 and is characterized by a disregard for and a violation of others' rights.E.

The features of autistic disorder are similar to Asperger's disorder, but also include impaired language skills. Asperger's disorder is thus considered to be a less severe variant of autism.C. In OCD, repetitive behaviors and interests may also be present, but these are intended to prevent or reduce distress in some way. Social skills are not primary affected.D. This patient does not demonstrate psychotic features such as delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized thought processes, which are required for the diagnosis of schizophrenia.E.

She also complains of constant anxiety, which is relieved only when she is performing on stage. She denies any history of substance abuse. She has had an extensive number of relationships with men, none lasting more than a few months. She brags about her ability to get men to buy her whatever she wants. On examination, she is wearing heavy make-up and a low-cut shirt, and refers to the doctor as &ldquo;honey&rdquo;. Her affect is labile, shifting rapidly from tears to laughter and back. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Histrionic personality disorder,Narcissistic personality disorder,Borderline personality disorder,Bipolar I disorder,Substance abuse,,1,"The attention-seeking behavior of patients with histrionic personality disorder manifests in a number of ways: through exaggerated displays of emotion, use of dramatic expressions in speech, use of their physical appearance to draw attention to themselves, and inappropriate familiarity and seductiveness. Because they are uncomfortable in situations where they are not the center of attention, they sometimes gravitate toward the entertainment industry.B. Patients with narcissistic personality disorder share histrionic patients' need for admiration, but their presentation is dominated by a grandiose sense of self-importance.C. Borderline personality disorder is also notable for affective instability and dramatic, unstable relationships, but identity disturbance is a key feature and the characteristic affect displayed is one of inappropriate anger.D. Many psychiatrists would consider this patient to have a bipolar spectrum illness because of her mood lability. However, the bipolar I diagnosis rests on the presence of a history of a full-blown manic episode, a seven-day period of elevated or irritable mood, along with symptoms of neurovegetative disturbance.E. Substance abuse is possible despite her denial. However, the history overall is characteristic for histrionic personality disorder, so that remains the most likely diagnosis. ",,

MAOIs such as phenelzine are also very effective in treatment of panic disorder.",,
3447,5,Psychiatry,"A 43-year-old female presents to the Emergency Room with severe anxiety. She reports that she had been taking alprazolam up to four times a day for panic attacks. Over the past few days, her anxiety symptoms are worse and she complains of trouble falling asleep and nausea. On further evaluation, she admits that she had recently skipped her regular doses because a friend told her that the medication she is taking is addicting. Which of the following would be the most appropriate intervention?",Discontinue alprazolam and switch her treatment with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor,Refer patient back to her outpatient physician,"Switch the patient to a longer-acting benzodiazepine, such as clonazepam","Educate patient on proper use of her medication, risks and signs of benzodiazepine withdrawal",,,4,"Discontinuation of benzodiazepines, such as alprazolam, can lead to relapse or rebound symptoms of anxiety, or more severe withdrawal symptoms. Rebound symptoms such as anxiety, insomnia, and GI symptoms are milder and short-lived. However, symptoms of withdrawal are more serious, such as agitation, tachycardia, palpitations, blurred vision, muscle cramps, and seizures. In an emergency setting, educating the patient about risks associated with discontinuation of benzodiazepines would be most appropriate and prevent more serious effects.",,

You decide that she does need antidepressant treatment and discuss many options with her. The one medication that you would hesitate to recommend in this patient would be:",Buspirone,Nefazodone,Sertraline,Bupropion,Fluoxetine,,4,"The most serious potential side effect of bupropion is seizures. The risk of having a seizure is increased when there is an eating disorder such as bulimia or anorexia. The mechanism is not understood at this time, but if possible an alternative agent should be used in this patient. The other options listed do not have a contraindication with a history of eating disorders.Never offer bupropion to a patient with:-A seizure disorder, stroke, brain turmor, brain surgery or closed head injury-A current or past eating disorder such as bulimia or anorexia nervosa-Use of alcohol or sedatives[Nefazodone (Serzone, Nefadar) is an antidepressant that was discontinued in May, 2004 in the United States and Canada due to the rare incidence of hepatotoxicity (liver damage), which could lead to the need for a liver transplant, or even death.]",,
3449,5,Psychiatry,"A 45-year-old man is evaluated for insomnia and anxiety. He dates the onset of his symptoms to one year ago, when he received a concussion in a car accident while working. In spite of a normal MRI scan of his brain taken on the day of the accident, he has suffered from headaches, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, poor memory, fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, and depressed mood. Once asleep, he frequently awakens with nightmares about the accident. He feels jumpy, and is short-tempered with his wife and coworkers. Driving, especially, is an ordeal for him, making him feel tense and irritable. He has missed six months of work in the past year because of these symptoms.  Which of the following diagnoses would be the LEAST likely? ",Post-traumatic stress disorder,Post-concussional disorder,Malingering,Acute stress disorder,Chronic subdural hematoma,,4,"Acute stress disorder is similar to post-traumatic stress disorder, but by DSM-IV definition, lasts a maximum of 4 weeks.A  B. With this history, the patient meets criteria for both post-traumatic stress disorder and post-concussional disorder as proposed by DSM-IV. The latter diagnosis is recognized by most neurologists and is believed to be attributable to diffuse microscopic shearing injuries to axons, which show up better on post-mortem dissection specimens than they do on MRI.C. Unfortunately, more so than with most injuries, one must consider malingering when assessing work-related injuries.E. Subdural hematoma may take weeks to accumulate after head injuries, and thus may not show up on brain imaging done at the time of the accident. ",,

Despite this, he continues to complain of hallucinations and a severely depressed mood, and states he will kill himself if discharged. It is noted that he is homeless, that the weather has been unseasonably cold recently, and that he admits he does not care to live in homeless shelters, citing how dangerous they can be.

The psychotic symptoms should resolve once the condition is adequately treated with an antidepressant. Usually the patient can be tapered off the haloperideol fairly quickly while continuing on the antidepressant. The risk of tardive dyskinesia is reduced by using the antipsychotic for as short a time period as possible, and using an atypical antipsychotic whenever possible.A. Most bipolar patients will require indefinite treatment with a mood stabilizer to prevent future episodes. If this is not done, it is believed that a kindling phenomenon occurs. This refers to the observation that future episodes will occur with progressively less time between them, more severe symptoms, and less of a response to treatment.C. This patient is at higher risk for a recurrence of symptoms since stabilization of mood is not sufficient to prevent psychosis.D.

DBT is a more practical type of therapy developed by Marsha Linehan and her colleagues aimed at reducing inappropriate behaviors and teaching skills to handle surges of emotion. Strategies include teaching the patient to do a chain analysis of what led up to an identified problematic event and identifying what alternatives could have been taken to avoid the event. Both individual and classroom group scenarios are utilized in DBT.,,
3455,5,Psychiatry,"A psychiatrist is consulted to see a 29-year-old woman who is being treated in an ICU for complications resulting from her intentionally overdosing on her medication. This is her fourteenth overdose in the past five years. All of them have been desperate attempts to stop various boyfriends from leaving her. Several of the ICU nurses complain that she is being mistreated by other nurses. They accuse these nurses of labeling her a &ldquo;problem patient&rdquo; despite her &ldquo;sweet and vulnerable nature&rdquo;, and of punishing her by ignoring many of her requests for care, and otherwise being rude to her. The accused nurses admit that she is indeed a difficult patient, but that despite her constant verbal abuse and hostility toward them, they have at all times been very polite to her. What would be the most appropriate management of the situation?",Report to the head of nursing that the ICU nursing team is unprofessional and unable to work together,"Tell the patient that next time she overdoses, she will have to go to another hospital","Call a meeting for the nurses, and invite a professional conflict mediator to help resolve their dispute","Call a meeting for the nurses, and explain the concept of splitting",Establish a token economy for the patient as a behavioral treatment,,4,"Splitting, a primitive defense mechanism where external objects are divided into categories of &ldquo;all good&rdquo; or &ldquo;all bad&rdquo;, is characteristically employed by patients with borderline personality disorder. When hospital staff are unwittingly coopted into these patients' defensive strategies, they may become divided against each other. The ICU nurses should be advised regarding the psychological dynamics of the patient, and on how to manage the countertransference (i.e., the feelings toward her) she provokes.A. Most nurses do not receive much training regarding psychological defense mechanisms; thus, this situation does not reflect on their professionalism.B.

Dantrolene blocks the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, producing muscle relaxation. Of course, the offending antipsychotic should be stopped. Bromocriptine acts as a dopamine receptor agonist, and amantadine enhances the synthesis, release and reuptake of dopamine.

Sacral agenesis with lumbar vertebral anomalies, poor growth of the caudal region, distal spinal cord disruption, and other anomalies are common in IDM.B. IDM infants are often large for gestational age, with increased body size and visceromegaly.C. Congenital heart disease is very common among IDM infants and includes transient hypertrophic subaortic stenosis, transposition of the great vessels, ASD, VSD, and aortic coarctation.E. Other midline defects, including CNS anomalies such as anencephaly, myelomeningocele, hydrocephalus, and microcephaly, are also common in IDM. ",,

Children with epiglottitis should be allowed to sit and lean forward to help their aiways open. All of these signs and symptoms are typical. As these children may obstruct totally at any time, rapid preparations must be made to maintain an airway.C. Reassurance and allowing the mother to hold the child will decrease distress while you arrange proper treatment.D. This child should be evaluated in a controlled setting (i.e., in an operating room in the presence of an anesthesiologist and/or otolaryngologist) so that rapid airway control may be achieved if necessary.E.

Billy's father had enuresis until age 10, but he outgrew the problem without any treatment. The mother has tried restricting fluids prior to bed, but this has not helped. What step in management would you do next? ",Order a urine culture and a voiding cystourethrogram,Counsel the mother that enuresis is a self-limited problem that requires no intervention,"Start oral medication, either imipramine or desmopressin",Counsel Billy and his mother on the use of a buzzer alarm conditioning device,Use negative reinforcement techniques to punish Billy when he has wet nights,,4,"Enuresis is a common problem that is usually self-limited, but treatment with buzzer alarm conditioning devices has been shown to be effective in about 75% of cases.A. Unless there is a history of urinary tract infection or an abnormal urinary stream, cultures and radiographic studies are not necessary.B. Intervention, when enuresis persists beyond 7-8 years of age, may decrease stress and embarrassment.C. While medications may work initially, most children start wetting again as soon as the medication is stopped. Since desmopressin is very expensive and imipramine may cause serious side effects if overdosed, medications should probably not be used as initial treatmentE.

Which of the following treatments is not appropriate for this spell? ,Administration of crystalloid,Morphine sulfate,Neo-synephrine,Nitroglycerin,Placing the child in a knee to chest position,,4,"Tet spells are caused by an increase in right ventricular outflow resistance leading to an increase in right-to-left shunting of blood, resulting in worsening cyanosis. These spells may resolve spontaneously, but may require treatment if they are sustained. The treatment of the spells is to diminish right-to-left shunting by increasing systemic vascular resistance (with the administration of neo-synephrine or the knee-to-chest maneuver), or decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance (with the administration of morphine sulfate). Volume is usually given concomitantly to increase the systemic blood pressure, which will also minimize right-to-left shunting. The administration of nitroglycerin would be expected to worsen a tet spell, as its vasodilator effects would lead to a decrease in systemic blood pressure and worsening right-to-left shunt.",,

","1/4 NS, 200 cc","1/2 NS, 200 cc","NS, 200 cc","NS, 400 cc","3% NS, 400 cc",,4,"Initial fluid resuscitation requires isotonic solution (NS/LR). Other solutions may result in further complications with electrolyte disturbances and inadequate treatment of shock. The estimation of deficit is important in small infants and children because of the relatively small intravascular volume, and over- or under-treatment can have serious consequences. Deficit is best calculated by loss of weight, but often pre-dehydration weights are unknown. Severe signs of dehydration, such as sunken fontanelle, lethargy, and dry mucous membranes place the deficit at 10% or greater. A 4-kg infant with 10% dehydration has a 400-cc deficit. An infant with slightly dry mucous membranes, tachycardia, and concentrated urine would suggest a dehydration of about 5%.

3574,2,OBGYN,"A 28-year-old secundigravida at 40 weeks' gestation is undergoing a trial of labor. Her prior delivery was complicated by cephalopelvic disproportion and required a low transverse cesarean section for delivery. For the last 4 hours, she has been on augmentation medication for her contractions. About 30 minutes ago she started complaining of persistent lower abdominal pain. Repetitive variable decelerations began at the same time. Your exam of the patient notes that she is 3 cm dilated, has moderate vaginal bleeding, and the presenting part is no longer palpable. What is the most likely diagnosis? ",Placental abruption,Placental previa,Uterine hyperstimulation,Uterine rupture,Cord prolapse,,4,"Given the prior cesarean section, the sudden onset of repetitive variable decelerations along with the sudden loss of fetal station is highly suspicious for uterine rupture. This occurs in about 0.5-1% of all women undergoing a trial of labor with a prior low transverse segment cesarean section. Classical uterine incisions have a much higher risk of uterine rupture, and labor is contraindicated in these women. Since uterine rupture can be catastrophic for both the mother and fetus, women who wish a trial of labor should deliver at a facility where emergency cesarean deliveries can be performed in a prompt and timely fashion.A. Abruption is often associated with uterine pain and bleeding, but should not be accompanied by a loss of fetal station.B. Previa is more often associated with painless vaginal bleeding. Also, the placenta would have been palpated during your pelvic exam.C. Uterine hyperstimulation can be associated with late decelerations and uteroplacental insufficiency. No loss of fetal station should occur.E. Cord prolapse would be palpable on pelvic exam. Loss of fetal station will increase this risk of this complication. Prolapse is not associated with bleeding and persistent pelvic pain. ",,

You determine that the current position of the fetal vertex (see Figure D) is:",Occiput anterior,Right occiput anterior,Left occiput anterior,Right occiput posterior,Left occiput posterior,ob211.jpg,5,"The position of the fetal vertex is determined by the location of the fetal occiput relative to the maternal pelvis. When the sagittal suture is in the anterior-posterior axis of the pelvis, with the occiput closest to the symphysis, the vertex is considered to be occiput anterior (OA). When the sagittal suture is in the transverse axis of the pelvis, the vertex is either right or left occiput transverse (ROT, LOT). In this diagram , the occiput, as noted by the triangular shape of the posterior fontanelle, is to the patient's left side and posterior.

3576,2,OBGYN,A 20-year-old multiparous woman underwent AFP testing at 16 weeks' gestation. The initial result was 0.3 multiple of the median (MoM) (normal 0.5-2.0 MoM). The result of a repeat test performed 5 days later was 0.2 multiple of the median. The abnormality most likely to be associated with these results is:,Trisomy 21,Triploidy,Twin pregnancy,Meningomyelocele,Trisomy 13,,1,"Due to the large overlap between a normal fetus and a fetus with trisomy 21 or 18, low alpha fetoprotein values should not be repeated, as the second value is more likely to be reported as normal (regression to the mean). Most patients now receive a triple screen, which includes AFP, HCG, and uE3. This triple screen test looks at the age-related risk for aneuploidy for each of the markers and then predicts a composite risk for both trisomy 21 and trisomy 18. With the triple screen, about 60-70% of all trisomy 21 pregnancies can be detected prenatally. In trisomy 18, all three values are low. Trisomy 13 cannot be screened by a low MSAFP.B. Triploidy is not associated with a low MSAFPC. Twin pregnancy is often associated with an elevated MSAFP when compared to a singleton pregnancyD. Open neural tube defects are associated with an elevated MSAFPE. Trisomy 13 cannot be routinely detected by the MSAFP value, unlike trisomies 18 and 21 ",,

The most likely diagnosis is:",Ruptured spleen,Ruptured uterus,Perforated viscus,Abruptio placentae,Ruptured bladder,,2,"In a car accident, the gravid uterus in the third trimester will have a rapid deceleration within the abdominal cavity which can increase the risk of a placental abruption, as well as uterine rupture. Most cases of abruption occur within 24 hours of the accident. In this case - the fetal heart tones are absent, her abdominal wall is tense and there is a clinical evidence of hypovolemia - one should suspect the more serious condition of uterine rupture. With her vital sign changes,  evaluation and correction of DIC as well as maternal blood volume replacement are indicated. The blood loss will continue until the uterus is repaired, therefore, Cesarean delivery of the fetus is indicated.Ruptured spleen can definitely be associated with significant hemorrhage and shock. But, the lower abdominal tenderness is more likely to be from a pelvic origin. Perforated viscus is uncommon without penetrating trauma.Abruption is a common occurrence in abdominal trauma of this nature. Due to the absent heart tones, tense abdomen, and signs of significant hypovolemia, uterine rupture is more likely.Ruptured bladder is not associated with absent fetal heart tones.",,

Bacteremia occurs in only 10% of cases. Once membranes are ruptured, the presence of a fever 100.4F. in the absence of any other explanation for the elevated temperature should strongly suggest chorioamnionitis. Amniocentesis can assist in the diagnosis, when no other clinical signs are present besides a fever. The presence of bacteria in the amniotic fluid, or a fluid glucose level of less than 15 mg/dl, is presumptive evidence for infection. Interleukin 6 has the highest sensitivity of any diagnostic test.A. Elevations in maternal leukocyte count can occur for a wide variety of reasons in pregnancy, including labor. It is not a reliable diagnostic finding.B. Maternal tachycardia is a nonspecific finding and can also be associated with a wide variety of conditions.C.

Late decelerations are felt to be consistent with uteroplacental insufficiency. This can be due to a number of reasons, including the following: the maternal circulation is not adequately perfusing the placental bed; maternal hypoxia; inadequate exchange across the placental bed (Abruption, infarct); and also inadequate fetal perfusion of the placenta. Since this is a recent change in the prior character of the fetal heart tracing and since the patient is on oxytocin infusion, allowing intrauterine resuscitation would be the most optimal choice. Should no improvement in the fetal condition occur, then the next step after this would be delivery.A. Instrumented vaginal delivery is never indicated before the cervix is completely dilated.B. Cesarean delivery would be indicated if measures to allow intrauterine resuscitation are unsuccessful (left lateral position, supplemental oxygen to the mother, discontinue contractions).C.

Increased intracranial pressure causes local changes in cerebral artery blood flow, leading to a reflexive bradycardia mediated by the vagal nerve. Although not all authors agree that this class of decelerations is distinct from variable decelerations, there is good evidence to suggest that early decelerations are not associated with fetal asphyxia. Early decelerations are most often seen around 4-6 cm of cervical dilation and should not have any associated tachycardia, loss of variability, or other heart rate changes.A. Instrumented vaginal delivery is never indicated before the cervix is completely dilated.B. Cesarean delivery would be indicated if evidence of uncorrectable fetal hypoxia should develop.C. Amnioinfusion is appropriate for repetitive variable decelerations due to oligohydramnios.

You tell her that shoulder dystocia has been associated with all of the following EXCEPT:,Previous shoulder dystocia,Maternal obesity,Paternal diabetes,Prolonged second stage of labor,Fetal macrosomia,,3,"Paternal diabetes has a genetic risk to the child, but does not pose any risk during pregnancy and delivery compared to other normal infants. If a patient is a gestational diabetic with a macrosomic fetus and a prior shoulder dystocia, a cesarean delivery is indicated.A. This is probably the greatest risk for another shoulder dystocia. If her prior delivery resulted in a dystocia (especially if the child has permanent sequelae), then most obstetricians would proceed with an elective cesarean delivery.B. Maternal obesity is associated with larger birth weights and an increased risk of complicated delivery.D. Prolonged second stage can be a warning feature of an impending shoulder dystocia.E.

A would-be mother must be informed that to become pregnant would incur a 50% risk of dying. Even if she survives, fetal mortality approaches 50% as well.A. Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis has a mortality in pregnancy of about 20%. Prevention of reduction in preload is necessary in all obstructive cardiac lesions. Balloon valvuloplasty can be done in pregnancy.B. Due to the increased blood volume and cardiac output in pregnancy, mitral stenosis can lead to severe pulmonary edema.

Perfusion scanning alone is recommended initially, and the ventilation scan is added when perfusion defects are noted. Pulmonary angiography might be necessary if lung scan findings are of low probability or indeterminate and clinical suspicion remains high.Note:Several studies show no increased risk of teratogenicity in patients undergoing radiological procedures in the diagnosis of maternal venous thromboembolic disease. A complete and adequate evaluation to document the presence or absence of PE requires less than 0.005 Gy. Obtaining the appropriate diagnostic study in pregnancies is mandatory.Although the chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, and arterial blood gas are part of the routine workup of chest pain, the diagnosis is made by either a ventilation perfusions can, spiral CT scan, or pulmonary angiography.

3620,2,OBGYN,"A 28-year-old G2P2 woman, noticed a painful mass in her left breast. Examination disclosed a discrete 2 cm apparently cystic mass in the upper outer quadrant. Supraclavicular and axillary areas were negative. Needle aspiration was done but it did not eliminate the mass. The most appropriate next step in management is:",Mammography,Excisional biopsy,Needle aspiration,Reexamination after onset of menses,Excisional biopsy with lymph nodes sampling,,1,"Initially, you should try to differentiate solid from cystic lumps because cysts are rarely cancerous. Typically, ultrasonography is done. Lesions that appear cystic are sometimes aspirated, and solid lumps are evaluated with mammography followed by imaging-guided biopsy. Sometimes evaluation of all lumps with needle aspiration is done; if no fluid is obtained or if aspiration does not eliminate the lump, mammography followed by imaging-guided biopsy is done. Additional notes:Fibrocystic changes (previously, fibrocystic disease) is a catchall term that refers to mastalgia, breast cysts, and nondescript lumpiness, which may occur in isolation or together; breasts have a nodular and dense texture and are frequently tender when palpated. Fibrocystic changes cause the most commonly reported breast symptoms and have many causes. Most causes are not associated with increased risk of cancer; they include adenosis, ductal ectasia, simple fibroadenoma, fibrosis, mastitis, mild hyperplasia, cysts, and apocrine or squamous metaplasia. Other causes, particularly if fibrocystic changes require biopsy, may slightly increase risk of breast cancer. Fibrocystic changes are more common among women who had early menarche, who had their first live birth at age  30, or who are nulliparous.Red flags: Certain findings are of particular concern:-Lump fixed to the skin or chest wall-Stony hard, irregular lump-Skin dimpling-Matted or fixed axillary lymph nodes-Bloody nipple dischargeInterpretation of findings: Painful, tender, rubbery lumps in younger women with a history of similar findings suggest fibrocystic changes.",,

Of the following, the best choice of contraceptive for this patient is:",Copper t380a intrauterine device (IUD),"Low-dose, combined oral contraceptives",Contraceptive implant (Norplant),Endometrial ablation,Hysterectomy,,3,"Any smoker over the age of 35 has a significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death if they are on oral contraceptive pills. Since she has heavy and painful menses, she is not an ideal candidate for the IUD. Endometrial ablation may lessen her menorrhagia, but it is not an accepted form of contraception. Norplant has no estrogen component; so it will not increase her risk of thromboembolic phenomena.A. Due to her heavy, painful menses, not a good candidate for the IUD.B. Smokers over 35 have an increased risk of MI and death when using estrogen-containing oral contraceptives.D. This is not an accepted method of contraception. It may reduce her degree of menorrhagia.E. Although this will successfully prevent pregnancy, contraception alone is not an acceptable indication for hysterectomy. ",,

Active bleeding is present, and the patient's hematocrit is 26%. Which of the following is optimal management at this time?",Transfusion and vaginal hysterectomy,Transfusion and abdominal hysterectomy,Biopsy of the mass and transfusion is necessary,Transvaginal myomectomy and transfusion if necessary,High dose birth control pills,,4,"The most likely diagnosis is a prolapsed submucous fibroid. If this patient were 80 years old, presenting in the same fashion, one would be suspicious of a stromal sarcoma. Although this could be a carcinoma, the simplest and safest way to stop the bleeding is to remove the mass vaginally (ligate the stalk and then excise). The mass can be sent for pathologic evaluation with further therapy is indicated.A. Although this would stop her bleeding, it carries a much higher risk to the patient (blood loss, ureteral injury, bladder injury). Should the mass turn out to be a malignancy, then the wrong procedure may have been done.B. See answer to A.C. Biopsy of the mass alone will not solve the bleeding. Since the stalk is visible and only 1.5 cm in diameter, then excision of the mass would be the best therapy.E. High dose birth control pills can be used for dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Here, the bleeding is due to a prolapsed fibroid. OCPs will not affect her bleeding and pain. ",,

The most likely diagnosis is:",Recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease,Ectopic pregnancy,Ruptured ovarian cyst,Endometriosis,Irritable bowel syndrome,,2,"With her prior history of PID, her chances of tubal damage are significantly elevated. Since she is pregnant with an HCG titer over 2000 mIU/ml, an intrauterine gestation sac should have been seen on the endovaginal ultrasound. With the moderate amount of free fluid in the cul-de-sac, along with the pelvic pain and normal white count and temperature, the index of suspicion for an ectopic must be high.A. The white count is normal and her temperature is normal as well. With a positive HCG titer, an ectopic should be the first suspicion.C. This can cause free fluid in the cul-de-sac as well as pelvic pain. With her history of PID in the past, the presence of tubal damage is high; so one should be much more suspicious of an ectopic. At an HCG titer of 5,400, an IUP should have been seen.D.

The next step in her evaluation should be:,Hysterectomy,Dilation and curettage,Endometrial biopsy,Endometrial ablation,Intermittent progestin therapy,,3,"In any woman over the age of 35, with abnormal uterine bleeding, the diagnosis of an endometrial malignancy must be entertained. With a postmenopausal woman having an endometrial stripe over 4-5 mm, cancer needs to be ruled out and tissue should be obtained. The simplest test is to proceed with an endometrial biopsy.A. This therapy would be indicated as therapy for adenocarcinoma of the endometrium or for atypical endometrial hyperplasia. A diagnostic sampling of the endometrium is the first necessary test.B. Although this test would lead to a diagnosis, an endometrial biopsy can be done more easily in the office with minimal discomfort.D.

The most likely diagnosis is:",Appendicitis,Torsion of ovary,Ectopic pregnancy,Rupture of corpus luteum,Rupture of tuboovarian abscess,,2,"Ovarian torsion may account for up to 3% of gynecologic emergencies requiring operative intervention. This usually occurs in a reproductive age woman who has an 8-12 cm benign mass of the ovary. Dermoids are the tumors most associated when a torsion has occurred, but paratubal and paraovarian cysts have the highest relative risk for torsion due to their thin stalk. If it is a benign cystic mass, and the ovary is not necrotic, the treatment of choice is a cystectomy with preservation of the remaining ovarian tissue. Preoperative Doppler flow can be helpful in determining the viability of the adnexa.A. Although right lower quadrant pain is commonly due to appendicitis, it is the sudden onset of cramping pain along with lack of a fever that suggests ovarian torsion as the most likely etiology.C. Urine pregnancy test being negative rules out ectopic.D. Rupture of an ovarian cyst can cause peritoneal findings. With the 8-cm tender mass, a torsion is more likely.E.

The most likely reason for urine loss is:",Stress incontinence,Urge incontinence,Vesicovaginal fistula,Detrussor dyssynergia,Neurogenic bladder,,1,"Based on the exam findings in this multiparous woman, one would suspect that an anatomic stress incontinence picture is the most likely. If she had a fistula, the leaking would occur even at rest. As she is otherwise healthy, the likelihood of a neurogenic bladder (seen in diabetes, neuromuscular disorders, spinal cord injury) is small.B. Urge incontinence, usually due to detrussor dyssynergia, has a hypercontractile bladder. The patient will sense the urge t void and often will not make it to the bathroom in time, as the spontaneous bladder contraction will cause urine loss. Anticholinergics are often used in this condition.C. This condition will lead to leaking at all times, even at rest, since the defect is above the urethral sphincter.D. See answer to B.E.

In infants and young children, RSV is the most important cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Rapid diagnostic assays, including immunofluorescent and enzyme immunoassay techniques for detection of viral antigen in nasopharyngeal specimens, are available commercially and are generally reliable.Unless there is evidence of a suppurative complication, such as otitis media, the treatment of RSV bronchiolitis is supportive (e.g., with hydration and supplemental oxygen). It is currently unclear whether there is a direct relationship between RSV bronchiolitis and a predisposition to asthma. In hospitalized infants with RSV bronchiolitis, corticosteroids are not effective and are not indicated.Antimicrobial agents such as amoxicillin are rarely indicated because bacterial lung infection and bacteremia are uncommon in children hospitalized with RSV bronchiolitis. Antimicrobial agents may be indicated with a suppurative complication.Palivizumab, a humanized mouse monoclonal antibody administered intramuscularly, is available to reduce the risk of RSV hospitalization in high-risk children. This medication is not indicated in this case because of a negative past history.

What is the younger brother's diagnosis?",Folie a deux,Capgras syndrome,Paranoid delusions,Fregoli delusion,Mirrored self misidentification,,1,"Folie a deux is where symptoms of a delusional belief is transmitted from one individual to another individual.  This syndrome is most commonly diagnosed when the two or more individuals concerned live in proximity and may be socially or physically isolated and have little interaction with other people.Capgras syndrome is where a person holds a delusion that a friend, spouse, parent or other close family member has been replaced by an identical-looking impostor.Fregoli delusion is a delusional belief that different people are in fact a single person who changes appearance or is in disguise.  May be related to a brain lesion, and is often of a paranoid nature with the delusional person believing themselves persecuted by the person they believe is in disguise.Mirrored self-misidentification is the delusional belief that one's reflection in a mirror is some other person (often believed to be someone who is following them around). Often people who suffer from this delusion are not delusional about anything else. ",,

What is this event identified as? ,Ventricular fibrillation,Torsades de Pointes,Supraventricular arrhythmias,Ventricular arrhythmias,Ventricular blockade,,2,"Torsades de Pointes is the event identified by twisted QRS complex and QT interval prolongation. Twisted QRS complex and QT interval prolongation occur due usage of the drugs that prolong ventricular repolarization. Antiarrhythmic drugs (like quinidine) and some antibiotics (like erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin) also result in elevation of QT interval. Other causes for Torsades de Pointes are diarrhea, hypomagnesia and hypokalemia. This is also witnessed in the people with chronic alcoholism. ",,
5380,1,Medicine,"A 60 year old man presents to your office complaining of low back pain.Over the past 2 years, the patient has been having progressively worsening pain while walking. On walking, he begins to experience low back pain as well as numbness in his thighs and calves. These symptoms persist until the patient sits down, bends his trunk and rests for a few minutes. He has no history of trauma. His past medical history is significant for essential hypertension diagnosed 10 years ago for which he takes losartan and hydrochlorothiazide. On examination, Temp is 36.60C, BP is 130/75 mmHg, pulse is 80/min and respiratory rate is 14/min. Neurologic exam reveals no weakness of his lower limbs, but there is decreased sensation in the S1 distribution with diminished ankle reflexes bilaterally. The straight leg raise test is negative bilaterally. Lower extremities pulsations are strong and regular.Which of the following is the best diagnostic test to confirm his suspected diagnosis? ",Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) measurement,CT Scan of the lumbar spine,Duplex ultrasound of the lower limbs,MRI of the lumbar spine,X-Ray of the lumbar spine,,4,"The most likely diagnosis for the patient's condition is neurogenic claudication due to degenerative spinal stenosis. It is important to take a detailed history from the patient as the claudication that is abolished when the patient stops walking is characteristic of vasculogenic claudication; however when it is relieved upon sitting and bending over this is almost pathognomonic for lumbar spinal stenosis. With normal peripheral pulses, this patient is unlikely to have peripheral vascular disease significant enough to cause his presenting symptoms. The most sensitive and specific test to confirm lumbar spinal stenosis is MRI of the lumbar spine.CT scan can suggest lumbar spinal stenosis; however, MRI is the gold standard for diagnosis; it can delineate the spinal cord impingement in the stenotic vertebral canal clearly.X-Ray of the spine is the most appropriate initial imaging to exclude other vertebral pathologies.ABI and Duplex of the lower limbs would be the best diagnostic testing for suspected peripheral vascular disease.

5273,1,Medicine,"A 63 year old male, with a history of arrhythmias, who is on antiarrhythmic drug therapy, was identified with twisted QRS complex and QT interval prolongation. What is the most preferred diagnostic test? ",Magnetic Resonance Imaging,Electrocardiogram,Chest X-ray,Angiography,Electrophysiological testing,,2,"Answer: B  Electrocardiogram is the most preferred diagnostic test for detection and evaluation of Torsades de Pointes. Electrocardiogram helps in identification of the twist of QRS complex and prolongation of QT segment. It has series of wave forms which denote the parts of heart and their functionality. P wave reflects the atrial depolarization; PR wave represents the spread of impulse through purkunjee fibers, QRS complex reflects ventricular depolarization and QT interval widening represents ventricular repolarization. A. Magnetic Resonance Imaging is not correct because it gives two dimensional image of the heart. C. Chest radiographs should be performed to rule out structural heart disease if any clinical suggestion is present (after EKG is done)D. Angiography is used to assess the condition and functioning of blood vessels but not the heart. E. Electrophysiological testing is used to locate the ectopic foci and to assess the therapeutic response to antiarrhythmiatic drugs.  ",,
5274,1,Medicine,"A 68 year old male with supra-ventricular tachycardia was treated with Quinidine. Which of the following medications can cause life-threatening arrhythmias, when it is given concomitantly with quinidine? ",Phenytoin,Phenobarbital,Amiodarone,Atenolol,Ramipril,,3,"Answer: C  With the exact mechanism not known, amiodarone (Cordarone), another type of antiarrhythmic drug, may decrease removal of quinidine by the kidneys or liver giving rise to elevated quinidine blood levels, which may result in life-threatening arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes. It is important, therefore, to decrease quinidine doses when it is given concomitantly with amiodarone.A. and B. Removal of quinidine by the liver is accelerated by phenobarbital, phenytoin (Dilantin), and rifampin (Rifamate), requiring an increase in quinidine dose.D. Atenolol is a beta blocking antihypertensive, which does not cause any toxic effects if given concomitantly with quinidine. E. Ramipril is an anti-hypertensive, which produces its action by blocking Angiotensin converting enzyme given in combination with quinidine does not produce any toxic effect.  ",,
5276,1,Medicine,A 63 year old male with uncontrolled hypertension comes to see you with complaints of weight gain and feeling tired. Lab results show low hemoglobin and low ferritin levels.  What is the possible reason for his hypertension? ,Hyposecretion of aldosterone,Normochromic anemia,Increased blood supply to renal arteries,Decreased blood supply to renal arteries,Decreased tissue peripheral resistance,,4,"Answer: D  Decreased blood supply to renal arteries is one of the reasons for the hypertension. Decrease in the blood supply to renal arteries stimulates the renin-angiotensin system. Renin converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I which is then converted to angiotensin II in the presence of angiotensin converting enzyme. Angiotensin II is a powerful vasoconstrictor, which results in increase of blood pressure. Angiotensin also stimulates the adrenal cortex for the release of aldosterone. Aldosterone decreases the reabsorption of the sodium from the blood and increases the retention of it in blood. Increased retention of the sodium in blood would increase the blood volume and further increase the blood pressure. A. Hyposecretion of aldosterone would result in hypotension.B. He has hypochromic anemia. C. Increased blood supply to renal arteries does not stimulate the renin-angiotensin system. E. Decreased tissue peripheral resistance leads to hypotension.  ",,

What is the best medication of choice for treatment of this patient? ",Hydrochlorothiazide,Propranolol,Nitroprusside,Captopril,Methyldopa,,4,"Answer: D  Captopril is the most appropriate medication for the treatment of stage I hypertension. Captopril inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme, which converts of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Captopril is most widely used medication for hypertension because of its efficient reduction of hypertension through renin-angiotensin system. Since the patient already has renal disease and diabetes, captopril is the ideal medication when compared to others. It is given as 6.25 mg thrice a day initially and increased gradually from 25-150 mg based on the requirement and dose response. Patients with more advanced nephropathy may experience greater benefits from these medications than patients with mild nephropathy.Patients who initiate ACE inhibitor (and presumably ARB) therapy should have creatinine levels checked shortly after starting the medication, and serum potassium levels should be monitored for hyperkalemia while the patient receives the medication.A. Borderline renal and/or hepatic insufficiency may be aggravated by hydrochlorothiazide.B. Propranolol is a non selective beta-blocking agent; can mask hypoglycemia.C. Nitroprusside has decreased efficacy in renal failure. Toxic levels of cyanide build up rapidly in patients with renal failure.E. Methyldopa is not the ideal medication for the stage I hypertension because it acts by reducing the total tissue peripheral and has direct effect on the blood vessels, which is not desirable for the patient with renal disease.

",Propranolol,Lisinopril,Amlodipine,Hydralazine,Telmisartan,,3,"Answer: C &ndash; Amlodipine is the right medication for hypertension in patients with angina pectoris. Calcium channel blockers inhibit the influx of the calcium ions through the calcium channels. This results in the relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle. Calcium channel blockers also produce systemic and coronary vasodilation by blocking the calcium ions influx. Since the calcium channel blockers produce relaxation of the smooth muscle of coronary arteries it is a good medication for the patients with angina pectoris. A. Propranolol can worsen this patient's diabetes. B. Lisinopril is not as effective as calcium channel blockers in this case.D. Hydralazine is not recommended for this patient because Hydralazine can cause tachycardia, potentially leading to myocardial ischemia and angina attacksE.

5279,1,Medicine,"A 70 year old female presents with heart failure resulting in shortness of breath, fatigue, exercise limitation and fluid retention in the form of peripheral and pulmonary edema. What is the pathophysiology of the disease? ",Concentric cardiac hypertrophy,Increased venous perfusion,Increased contractility of the myocardium,Inactivation of sympathetic nervous system,Increase in cardiac output,,1,"Cardiac hypertrophy occurs when terminally differentiated cardiac myocytes respond to an increase in workload or injury (such as hypertension or myocardial infarction) by increasing cell size to maintain a normal cardiac output. This decreases the contractility of the myocardium of the heart, resulting in decreased output of the blood pumped by it. This also decreases the size of the chambers of heart. Physiologic hypertrophy or &quot;athlete's heart&quot; is the normal response to healthy exercise or pregnancy, which results in an increase in the heart's muscle mass and pumping ability. Pathological hypertrophy is the response to stress or disease such as hypertension, heart muscle injury (myocardial infarction) or neurohormones. Valvular heart disease is another cause of pathological hypertrophy. Concentric LV hypertrophy occurs in aortic stenosis, hypertension, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",,
5281,1,Medicine,"A 67 year old male patient with history of chronic hypertension, obesity and cigarette smoking experienced fluid retention along with symptoms of heart failure. Which of the following medications could worsen his heart failure? ",Digitalis,Furosemide,Vasopressin,Lisinopril,Metoprolol,,3,"Answer: C  In heart failure, Vasopressin worsens heart failure by causing vasoconstriction of arteries and veins, potentially contributing to remodeling of the left ventricle and causing fluid retention and worsening of hyponatremia. A. Digitalis increases the force of contraction and cardiac output and helps in reduction of the risk of heart failure. B. Furosemide is decreases the uptake of the water or fluids from the kidney and decreases the retention there by reducing the risk of heart failure. D. Lisinopril reduces the risk of heart failure and one of the best medications used for heart failure. It is an ACE inhibitor, which inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which is a potent vasoconstrictor. E. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker which decreases the risk of heart failure by blocking the beta-receptors.  ",,
5282,1,Medicine,"A 63 year old male patient is loaded with digitalis - 0.5 mg every 8 hours for three doses, followed by 0.20 mg per day. After several days he started complaining about visual changes and gastrointestinal disturbances. Today, cardiac arrhythmia is present. All of the following should be included in management of this patient, except:   ",Check serum digitalis and potassium levels,EKG,Administration of antiarrhythmic agents,Administration of digitalis antibodies,Correct electrolyte status,,3,"In spite of its limited benefits and recognized hazards, digitalis is still heavily used and toxicity is common. Therapy for toxicity manifested as visual changes or gastrointestinal disturbances generally requires no more than reducing the dose of the drug. If cardiac arrhythmia is present and can be ascribed to digitalis, more vigorous therapy may be necessary. Serum digitalis and potassium levels and the electrocardiogram should always be monitored during therapy of significant digitalis toxicity. Electrolyte status should be corrected if abnormal.In severe digitalis intoxication, serum potassium will already be elevated at the time of diagnosis (because of potassium loss from the intracellular compartment of skeletal muscle and other tissues). Furthermore, automaticity is usually depressed, and antiarrhythmic agents administered in this setting may lead to cardiac arrest. Such patients are best treated with prompt insertion of a temporary cardiac pacemaker catheter and administration of digitalis antibodies (digoxin immune fab). These antibodies recognize digitoxin and cardiac glycosides from many other plants in addition to digoxin. They are extremely useful in reversing severe intoxication with most glycosides.Digitalis-induced arrhythmias are frequently made worse by cardioversion; this therapy should be reserved for ventricular fibrillation if the arrhythmia is glycoside-induced.",,

",Myocardial infraction,TIA,Angina pectoris,Bradyarrhythmia,GERD,,3,"Angina pectoris is characterized by squeezing or gripping pain which is suffocating and heavy, sustained for few minutes radiating to jaw, neck, shoulders and arms. Angina pectoris occurs due to coronary blockade either through coronary stenosis or atherosclerosis. If coronary artery, the only artery that supplies blood to myocardium, is blocked due to stenosis or atherosclerosis, blood supply to myocardium would be stopped. Angina is one of the ischemic heart diseases that if left untreated, it would lead to myocardial infarction. ",,

He states it always happens when he is lying in his bed or watching TV lying on his couch and is unrelated to his exercise. Identify the type of angina patient is experiencing. ,Prinzmetal's angina,Unstable angina,Stable angina,Angina decubitus,Variant angina,,4,Answer: D &ndash; Angina decubitus is angina that occurs when a person is lying down (not necessarily only at night) without any apparent cause. Angina decubitus occurs because gravity redistributes fluids in the body. This redistribution makes the heart work harder.A. Prinzmetal's angina is induced by coronary artery spasm which is reflected by either permanent blockade or blockade due to plaque. This usually occurs at rest. B. Unstable angina occurs at rest in patients with significant coronary artery disease. Angina occurs frequently for extended periods of more than 20 minutes with a week's presence. C. Stable angina occurs due to exertion or stress. This type of angina is relieved by rest or by nitrates. E. Variant angina is just another name for Prinzmetal's angina.  ,,

Her resting ECG is normal. What is the most appropriate diagnostic test for the above patient? ,EECP,Angiography,Stress testing,Thallium imaging,Chest X-ray,,3,"Answer: C &ndash; Graded exercise stress testing is the most widely used test for the evaluation of patients presenting with chest pain. In patients with established stable angina pectoris, it also can provide prognostic information about the extent of disease.Exercise stress testing can be performed alone and in conjunction with echocardiography or myocardial perfusion scintigraphy tests. Stress echocardiography has an overall sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 86%; myocardial perfusion scintigraphy has an overall sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 77%. A. EECP is for therapeutic use. In patients whose angina is refractory to medical therapy who are not suitable candidates for either percutaneous or surgical revascularization, enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) is a safe and noninvasive alternative therapy.B. Consider coronary angiography in symptomatic patients with inconclusive noninvasive study results, in survivors of sudden cardiac death, in those who are considered to have a poor prognosis based on the results of noninvasive studies, in those with occupational requirements for a definite diagnosis (eg, pilots), or in patients with coronary artery disease who are severely symptomatic despite maximal medical therapy.D. Thallium Tl 201 and technetium Tc 99m sestamibi are the most frequently used myocardial perfusion scintigraphy tests. These tests are especially useful in patients with baseline ECG abnormalities, to localize the region of ischemia, and as prognostic indicators.E.

5288,1,Medicine,Ischemic pain of the heart develops when the oxygen demand by the myocardium exceeds the supply to it by coronary arteries either due to coronary artery disease or blockade due to atherosclerosis or clot formation. Which of the following does not  increase myocardial oxygen demand? ,Increased myocardial contractility ,Increased left ventricular diastolic volume,Aortic valve stenosis,Decrease in systemic vascular resistance,Ventricular dilation,,4,"Oxygen demand is a concept that is closely related to the oxygen consumption of an organ. The two terms are often used interchangeably although demand is related to need, whereas consumption is the actual amount of oxygen consumed per minute. Under some conditions, demand may exceed consumption because the latter may be limited by the delivery of oxygen to the myocardium.Major determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption are: Tension, Preload, Afterload, Contractility, Heart Rate. Doubling heart rate approximately doubles MVO2 because ventricular myocytes are generating twice the number of tension cycles per minute.Increasing inotropy (contractility) also increases MVO2 because the rate of tension development is increased as well as the magnitude of tension, both of which result in increased ATP hydrolysis and oxygen consumption. Increasing preload (ventricular end-diastolic volume) also increases MVO2;Afterload is increased when aortic pressure and systemic vascular resistance are increased, by aortic valve stenosis, and by ventricular dilation. When afterload increases, there is an increase in end-systolic volume and a decrease in stroke volume.",,

Performed coronary angiography revealed right coronary artery occlusion by thrombi. Which of the following antithrombotic agents  actively lyses preformed clot? ,Clopidogrel,Heparin,Aspirin,Nitroglycerin,Streptokinase,,5,"Answer: E Thrombolysis is generally preferred to PCI in cases where the time from symptom onset is less than 3 hoursStreptokinase - Nonfibrin specific agent with a half-life of 23 min that acts with plasminogen to convert plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin degrades fibrin clots as well as fibrinogen and other plasma proteins. An increase in fibrinolytic activity that degrades fibrinogen levels for 24-36 h takes place with intravenous infusion of streptokinase.A. Clopidogrel - Selectively inhibits adenosine diphosphate (ADP) binding to platelet receptor and subsequent ADP-mediated activation of glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation.B. Heparin - Augments activity of antithrombin III and prevents conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Does not actively lyse preformed clot, but it is able to inhibit further thrombogenesis after thrombolysis.C. Aspirin - Inhibits cyclooxygenase, which produces thromboxane A2, a potent platelet activator. Early administration has been shown to reduce 35-d mortality rate by 23%.

",Myocardial infarction and troponin levels,Angina pectoris and streptokinase levels,Lymphoma and lactic dehydrogenase levels,Arrhythmias and myoglobin levels,Myocardial infarction and amylase levels,,1,"Answer: A &ndash; This patient is clearly suffering from myocaridal infarction (MI). Current clinical practice is to measure two different cardiac enzymes when an MI is suspected: creatine kinase (CK), and troponin (T). CK is released into the bloodstream 4 to 6 hours after heart cell damage occurs, and peak blood levels of CK are seen after 24 hours. Elevated CK levels usually, but not always, indicate heart muscle damage. T is released into the bloodstream 2 to 6 hours after heart cell damage, and blood levels peak in 12 to 26 hours. Troponin is the preferred biomarker for diagnosis. Troponins have the greatest sensitivity and specificity in detecting MI. The test result is both diagnostic as well as prognostic of outcome.B. Streptokinase lis a thrombolytic. It's a nonfibrin specific agent with a half-life of 23 min that acts with plasminogen to convert plasminogen to plasmin. Besides, this is not a typical presentation of angina pectorisC. This presentation is not typical for lymphoma. D. Myoglobin, a low-molecular-weight heme protein found in cardiac and skeletal muscle, is released more rapidly from infarcted myocardium than troponin and CK-MB and may be detected as early as 2 hours after MI.

5297,1,Medicine,A 52 year old man with a history of seizure attacks suffered from loss of consciousness and tonic and clonic muscular contractions. His tongue fell back into his throat and he choked. What is the best diagnostic test for assessment of the presenting condition of this patient? ,X-rays,CT-Scan,Electroencephalogram,Discography,Fluoroscopy,,3,"Answer: C  Electroencephalogram is the appropriate diagnostic test to be employed for the identification and assessment of grandmal seizures. Electroencephalogram displays the electrical activity of the brain through the electrodes connected. In this procedure plain and flat electrodes are used to detect the electrical changes of the brain. Brain cells communicate through electrical impulses, which would be detected by the electrodes and recorded. It is the major diagnostic test for not only grand mal seizure but also for other seizure disorders. X ray or CT scan is not the right choice of diagnostic test for grandmal seizure. Discography is also not the right choice of diagnostic test for identification and assessment of the grandmal seizure because it is done for the patients going for lumbar surgery. This involves the insertion of a thin needle into the lumbar disc by giving the anesthesia guided by x-rays. Fluoroscopy is not the appropriate choice of diagnostic test for grandmal seizure because it is used to take the images of the body parts in motion.  ",,
5298,1,Medicine,A 52 year old male with a history of seizure attacks suffered from loss of consciousness and tonic and clonic muscular contractions. His tongue fell back into his throat and he choked. What is the best and most prior medication for the treatment of this condition? ,Phenytoin,Valproic acid,Tiagabine,Phenobarbital,Carbamazepine,,2,"Answer: B  Valproic acid is considered the agent of first choice for the treatment of grandmal (tonic-clonic) seizures. It increases the levels of GABA by affecting the potassium channels and also creates direct membrane stabilizing effect. Since it acts through GABA it is the best medication for grandmal seizures with fewer side effects. It is administered orally with a dose of 1000-3000 mg in divided doses. Medication should be taken with food to reduce the GI upset. Phenytoin and carbamazepine are reasonable second options among the older group of medications, but the newer medications tend to work equally well if not better and have better side effect profiles, especially long-term side effect.Tiagabine is a weak medication for the treatment of grandmal seizure and it is effective for the treatment of petitmal seizures. Phenobarbital is also not the choice of medication for grandmal seizure but it is a good choice for status epilepticus.  ",,

5300,1,Medicine,A 58 year old male with a history of seizure attacks suffered from a 30min loss of consciousness with repetitive seizures with no recovery of consciousness between attacks. What is the best initial treatment for his condition? ,Diazepam,Phenytoin,Phenobarbital,Carbamazepine,Valproic acid,,1,"Status epilepticus (SE) is prolonged, repetitive seizure activity that lasts more than 20 to 30 minutes, during time which the patient is unconscious. Status epilepticus is a medical emergency with a significantly poor outcome; it can result in death if not treated aggressively.A useful algorithm for the treatment of SE is as follows:Start an IV line, administer a 50-mL bolus of 50% dextrose IV and 100 mg of thiamine, then start the anticonvulsant. In some settings where drug intoxication might be likely, consider also adding naloxone at 0.4-2.0 mg IV to the dextrose bag.Administer diazepam (0.15 mg/kg) or lorazepam (0.1 mg/kg) IV over 5 minutes, followed preferably by fosphenytoin (15-20 mg phenytoin equivalents PE/kg at a rate not to exceed 150 mg PE/min) or phenytoin (18-20 mg/kg at a rate not to exceed 50 mg/min). Never mix phenytoin with a 5% dextrose solution; put it in a normal saline solution to minimize the risk of crystal precipitation.Intubate if necessary, and control hyperthermia.If seizures continue after 20 minutes, give additional fosphenytoin (10 mg PE/kg IV) or phenytoin (10 mg/kg IV). Aim for a total serum phenytoin level of about 22-25 g/mL.If seizures continue after 20 minutes, give phenobarbital (15 mg/kg IV). Several other alternatives to phenobarbital, such as valproate, levetiracetam, propofol, midazolam, or pentobarbital, are shorter acting than phenobarbital and allow for periodic neurologic assessments.If seizures continue, consider administering general anesthesia with medications such as propofol, midazolam, or pentobarbital titrated by IV drip to a burst-suppression pattern in the EEG trace.

However, these side effects resolve upon lowering the dose or discontinuing the medication.Amantadine inhibits the N -methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor-mediated stimulation of acetylcholine release. It may also enhance dopamine release, inhibit dopamine reuptake, stimulate postsynaptic dopamine receptors, or enhance dopamine receptor sensitivity. It provides some benefit for tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia.MAO-B inhibitors provide mild symptomatic benefit, have excellent side effect profiles, and may improve long-term outcomes. These characteristics make MAO-B inhibitors a good choice as initial treatment for many patients. When the MAO-B inhibitor alone is not sufficient to provide good control of motor symptoms, another medication (eg, dopamine agonist or levodopa) is added. ",,

5320,1,Medicine,"A 35 year old male presents with cough, breathlessness, wheeze and tightness in his chest. He states that all this has started after 15mins of his afternoon jogging. What is the most likely diagnosis of his condition? ",Emphysema,Allergies,Asthma,Bronchitis,Unstable Angina,,3,"Answer: C  Asthma is characterized by cough, breathlessness, wheezing and tightness of chest. Since the patient suffered from the symptoms after exercise, it is known as exercise induced asthma. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways due to inflammatory responses or airway obstruction or hyperresponsiveness or air way remodeling. Factors which precipitate the asthma are allergens, chemical irritants, flour, wood, textile chemicals, viral infections, exercise, emotions and few drugs. Allergens like pollen are the most common allergen responsible for the cause of asthma. Chemical irritants like industrial pollutants are also responsible for precipitating the asthma. Depression, anxiety and excess laughing also trigger asthma. A. Emphysema is one of the chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases marked by lysis of the alveoli resulting in formation of sac like structures.B. Allergies present differently (teary eyes, runny nose...usually not with sudden onset)D. Bronchitis is unlikely due to presentation. (not exercise induced, usually accompanied by fever, sore throat etc)E. Unstable Angina usually occurs at rest or with minimal exercise and does not present with cough or wheezing. ",,
5321,1,Medicine,"A 35 year old male presents with cough, breathlessness, wheeze and tightness in his chest. He states that all this has started after 15mins of his afternoon jogging. Which of the following should be obtained as the primary test to establish this patient's diagnosis? ",X-rays,Peak flow rate,Allergy test,Spirometry,Pulse oximetry,,4,"Answer: D &ndash; Spirometry assessments should be obtained as the primary test to establish the asthma diagnosis. Spirometry should be performed prior to initiating treatment in order to establish the presence and determine the severity of baseline airway obstruction.Spirometry gathers many measurements; the primary ones are:-the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1);-the forced vital capacity (FVC);-the ratio of the FEV1 divided by the FVC (the FEV1/FVC or more simply the FEV1%);-the peak expiratory flow (PEF); and-the forced expiratory time (FET100%).A. In most patients with asthma, chest radiography findings are normal or may indicate hyperinflation. B. Peak-flow monitoring is designed for ongoing monitoring of patients with asthma because the test is simple to perform and the results are a quantitative and reproducible measure of airflow obstruction. Peak-flow monitoring should not be used as a substitute for spirometry to establish the initial diagnosis of asthma.C. Allergy skin testing is a useful adjunct in individuals with atopy. Results help guide indoor allergen mitigation or help diagnose allergic rhinitis symptoms.E. Pulse oximetry is  a non-invasive way to measure oxygenation of blood or how well oxygen is being exchanged between the lungs and the blood. It is not diagnostic. ",,

Vitals are stable and physical exam shows oozing of blood from the nose, gums and IV lines. You order some lab tests which show normal platelet count, but an abnormal PT (INR=3.9), a high normal aPTT (37 sec) and a normal bleeding time (3min). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?",Acquired factor VIII deficiency,DIC,Scurvy,Vitamin K deficiency,Von Willebrand disease,,4,"Vitamin K deficiency is the most likely diagnosis of our patient. The body gets vitamin K from two sources: exogenous from the food and endogenous from the bacterial production of vitamin K in the colon. Our patient is taking broad spectrum antibiotics (loss of bacteria thus the endogenous source) and is NPO for a week (loss of the exogenous source). Coagulation profile usually shows prolongation of PT followed by prolonged PTT. PT is almost always more elevated than PTT.Acquired VIII deficiency would give a coagulation profile similar to hemophilia A i.e. normal PT, abnormal PTT, normal bleeding time and normal platelets count.Von Willebrand disease will present in younger age groups with abnormal PTT and bleeding time.DIC is common in the hospital setting and would present in a similar presentation to our patient; however all the coagulation will be disturbed (low platelet count, high PTT, high PT and high bleeding time).Scurvy (Vit C def) should be suspected in malnourished patients; a bleeding time is usually prolonged because of the vascular fragility.Know how to diagnose Vit K def! On the exam you may not have the same scenario! Remember the warfarin overdose (Vit K antagonist) and the hemorrhagic disease of the newborn.",,

5424,1,Medicine,"You have been a family doctor of Mr. Smith, a 50 year old hypertensive man, for 10 years.2 weeks, you have diagnosed Mr. Smith with diabetes mellitus. After appropriate counseling and management of his condition, what is the best screening test for nephropathy that you should order? ",Abdominal CT scan,Creatinine clearance,Dipstick testing,HbA1C,Urine for albumin/creatinine ratio,,5,The patient is at high risk for developing nephropathy because he has both diabetes and hypertension. The best and most convenient screening test for nephropathy is spot urine testing for albumin/creatinine ratio to detect microalbuminuria which is the earliest manifestation of diabetic nephropathy. A ratio less than 30 is normal while a ratio between 30 and 300 suggests microalbuminuria.Creatinine clearance is useful for assessment of advanced renal disease.Dipstick detects macroalbuminuria and not microalbuminuria which is a late manifestation of the nephropathy.CT scan of the abdomen is appropriate to delineate gross lesions of the kidney and is never appropriate for nephropathy screening.HbA1C is a screening test for diabetes control in the last three months and does not reflect the kidney condition.,,

After a detailed history and physical exam, you ordered several blood tests which were significant for a microcytic anemia and elevated ESR. Colonoscopy reveals extensive disease from terminal ileum to the rectum with multiple ulcerations. Biopsies of the lesions reveal the presence of non-caseating granulomas. Which of the following findings would suggest Crohn's disease rather than ulcerative colitis? ",Crypt abscess,Elevated ESR,Hyperplastic polyps,Non caseating granulomas,Pseudomembranes,,4,"Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the two major types of inflammatory bowel diseases. Non-caseating granulomas are pathognomonic of CD, and not seen in UC. However, it should be noted that they are present in most and not all patients with CD.Elevated ESR is a very non-specific marker of inflammation; it can be elevated in inflammatory, neoplastic and rheumatic diseases.Crypt abscesses may be seen in both UC and CD.Pseudomembranes are the hallmarks of Clostridium difficile colitis.Hyperplastic polyps are inflammatory polyps that denote chronic inflammatory diseases; they are non specific lesions.",,

",Clostridium difficile colitis,Colon cancer,Crohn's disease,Typhoid enteritis,Ulcerative colitis,,5,"This patient has classic presentation of toxic megacolon. The most common cause of toxic colon is inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially ulcerative colitis. The three week history of diarrhea in a young person that has worsened dramatically ending in bowel obstruction with systemic toxicity is a classic scenario of ulcerative colitis complicated with toxic megacolon. Toxic megacolon is an emergent life threatening condition that should be managed immediately with IV fluids, steroids and NG tube.Although Crohn's disease can also lead to a fulminant colitis, it is very rare.Colon cancer is very unlikely to present as toxic megacolon; moreover, the patient's young age favors against this diagnosis.Intestinal perforation, not fulminant colitis, is the classic complication described in typhoid fever.In the absence of antibiotics intake, pseudomembrenous colitis becomes unlikely.",,

The symptoms and thyroid function tests point to hyperthyroidism however the low uptake scan with the low thyroglobulin level denotes an exogenous source of the thyroid hormones. Patients with factitious disorder deliberately create or exaggerate symptoms of an illness in several ways. They may lie about or mimic symptoms, hurt themselves to bring on symptoms, or alter diagnostic tests (such as contaminating a urine sample). People with factitious disorders seek internal, primary (psychological) gain.Grave's disease would give a diffusely enlarged thyroid with a diffuse high uptake scan of the thyroid.Hypothyroidism is neither suggested clinically nor by lab tests.Toxic multinodular goiter would give a big nodular thyroid along with hot toxic nodules on the iodine uptake scan.Acute thyroiditis may give thyrotoxic symptoms initially due to the inflamed follicles releasing thyroid hormones; however, the thyroglobulin levels would be very high.",,

It is more common in firstborns, females, breech presentations, oligohydramnios, and patients with a family history of developmental dysplasia. Experts are divided with regard to whether hip subluxation can be merely observed during the newborn period, but if there is any question of a hip problem on examination by 2 weeks of age, the recommendation is to refer to a specialist for further testing and treatment. Studies show that these problems disappear by 1 week of age in 60% of cases, and by 2 months of age in 90% of cases. Triple diapering should not be used because it puts the hip joint in the wrong position and may aggravate the problem. Plain radiographs may be helpful after 46 months of age, but prior to that time the ossification centers are too immature to be seen. Because the condition can be difficult to diagnose, and can result in significant problems, the current recommendation is to treat all children with developmental dysplasia of the hip. Closed reduction and immobilization in a Pavlik harness, with ultrasonography of the hip to ensure proper positioning, is the treatment of choice until 6 months of age. The current guidelines recommend ultrasound screening at 6 weeks for breech girls, breech boys (optional), and girls with a positive family history of developmental dysplasia of the hip. Other countries have recommended universal screening, but a review of the literature has not shown that the benefits of early diagnosis through universal screening outweigh the risks and potential problems of overtreating.

Patients usually describe pain in the heel on taking the first several steps in the morning, with the symptoms lessening as walking continues. They frequently relate that the pain is localized to the medial calcaneal tubercle. The pain is usually insidious, with no history of acute trauma.Treatment strategies include relative rest, ice, NSAIDs, and prefabricated shoe inserts that provide arch support, as well as heel cord and plantar fascia stretching. Stretching the Achilles tendon is beneficial as adjunctive therapy for plantar fasciitis. Night splints that maintain the foot at an angle of 90 degrees or more to the ankle have recently been used as adjunctive therapy as well.Currently, there is evidence against the use of extracorporeal shockwave therapy.

The characteristic laboratory findings are a low serum free T4 and a low TSH. A free T4 level is needed to evaluate the proper dosage of replacement therapy in secondary hypothyroidism. The TSH level is not useful for determining the adequacy of thyroid replacement in this case, and the low level would prevent the physician from determining whether the dosage of levothyroxine is appropriate.

She reports that normal periods have resumed since cessation of breastfeeding 6 months ago. She takes ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate (Ortho Tri-Cyclen) for birth control. A complete review of systems is otherwise negative. The most likely cause of the discharge is,a medication side effect,breast cancer,a hypothalamic tumor,hypothyroidism,,,1,"This patient has galactorrhea, which is defined as a milk-like discharge from the breast in the absence of pregnancy in a non-breastfeeding patient who is more than 6 months post partum. It is more common in women ages 2035 and in women who are previously parous. It also can occur in men. Medication side effect is the most common etiology. The most common pharmacologic cause of galactorrhea is oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptives that contain estrogen can both suppress prolactin inhibitory factor and stimulate the pituitary directly, both of which can cause galactorrhea. Other medications that can cause galactorrhea include metoclopramide, cimetidine, risperidone, methyldopa, codeine, morphine, verapamil, SSRIs, butyrophenones, dopamine-receptor blockers, tricyclics, phenothiazines, and thioxanthenes. Breast cancer is unlikely to present with a bilateral milky discharge. The nipple discharge associated with cancer is usually unilateral and bloody. Pituitary tumors are a pathologic cause of galactorrhea due to the hyperprolactinemia that is caused by the blockage of dopamine from the hypothalamus, or by the direct production of prolactin. However, patients often have symptoms such as headache, visual disturbances, temperature intolerance, seizures, disordered appetite, polyuria, and polydipsia. Patients with prolactinomas often have associated amenorrhea. These tumors are associated with marked levels of serum prolactin, often 200 ng/mL. Hypothalamic lesions such as craniopharyngioma, primary hypothalamic tumor, metastatic tumor, histiocytosis X, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and empty sella syndrome are significant but infrequent causes of galactorrhea, and generally cause symptoms similar to those of pituitary tumors, particularly headache and visual disturbances. It is rare for primary hypothyroidism to cause galactorrhea in adults. Symptoms that would be a clue to this diagnosis include fatigue, constipation, menstrual irregularity, weight changes, and cold intolerance.  ",,

In addition to ST elevation 1 mm in two or more contiguous standard limb leads and 2 mm in two or more contiguous precordial leads, patients should also have new left bundle branch block. In a patient with a presumed MI, left bundle branch block suggests occlusion of the left anterior descending artery, placing a significant portion of the left ventricle in jeopardy. Thrombolytic therapy could be harmful in patients with ST-segment depression only. Frequent unifocal ventricular ectopy may warrant antiarrhythmic therapy, but not thrombolytic therapy.",,

The primary care physician should make sure that international travelers are up to date on routine immunizations, given that vaccine-based immunity to tetanus, diphtheria, polio, and measles wanes over time, and that these diseases are highly prevalent abroad. While location-specific situations may require particular immunizations such as typhoid, yellow fever, or hepatitis B vaccine, and/or administration of -globulin, hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for nearly all international travelers.",,
5452,1,Medicine,"A 55-year-old male who has a long history of marginally-controlled hypertension presents with gradually increasing shortness of breath and reduced exercise tolerance. His physical examination is normal except for a blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg, bilateral basilar rales, and trace pitting edema. Which one of the following ancillary studies would be the preferred diagnostic tool for evaluating this patient? ",12-lead electrocardiography,Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs,2-dimensional echocardiography with Doppler,Radionuclide ventriculography,Cardiac MRI,,3,"The most useful diagnostic tool for evaluating patients with heart failure is two-dimensional echocardiography with Doppler to assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular size, ventricular compliance, wall thickness, and valve function. The test should be performed during the initial evaluation. Radionuclide ventriculography can be used to assess LVEF and volumes, and MRI or CT also may provide information in selected patients. Chest radiography (posteroanterior and lateral) and 12-lead electrocardiography should be performed in all patients presenting with heart failure, but should not be used as the primary basis for determining which abnormalities are responsible for the heart failure.",,
5453,6,Surgery,"A 45-year-old white male is admitted to the intensive-care unit after being pinned in a car wreck for 2 hours. He has sustained several broken bones and crush injuries to both thighs. On admission his urine is clear but the next morning it is burgundy colored. Some fresh urine is drawn from his Foley catheter and sent for analysis, with the following results: Specific gravity. ......... 1.020 pH................... 6.0 Protein................ 30 mg/dL (N 114) Glucose. .............. negative Hemoglobin............. 4+ Urobilinogen. ........... 0.1 Ehrlich Units (N 0.11.0) Bile.................. negative RBCs................. 12/hpf WBCs. ............... 02/hpf Occasional hyaline casts You immediately order a CBC which shows his hematocrit to have dropped 4 percentage points overnight. Visual inspection of the serum shows it is clear. The color of his urine is most likely due to  ",myoglobinuria,hematuria from trauma to the urinary tract,a transfusion reaction with hemolysis of RBCs and free hemoglobin into the urine,hemoglobinuria resulting from reabsorption of hemoglobin from hematomas,acute porphyria provoked by trauma,,1,"A positive dipstick for hemoglobin without any RBCs noted in the urine sediment indicates either free hemoglobin or myoglobin in the urine. Since the specimen in this case was a fresh sample, significant RBC hemolysis within the urine would not be expected. If a transfusion reaction occurs, haptoglobin binds enough free hemoglobin in the serum to give it a pink coloration. Only when haptoglobin is saturated will the free hemoglobin be excreted in the urine. Myoglobin is released when skeletal muscle is destroyed by trauma, infarction, or intrinsic muscle disease. If the hematuria were due to trauma there would be many RBCs visible on microscopic examination of the urine. Free hemoglobin resorption from hematomas does not occur. Porphyria may cause urine to be burgundy colored, but it is not associated with a positive urine test for hemoglobin.",,
5454,1,Medicine,"A 44-year-old black female reports diffuse aching, especially in her upper legs and shoulders. The aching has increased, and she now has trouble going up and down stairs because of weakness. She has no visual symptoms, and a neurologic examination is normal except for proximal muscle weakness. Laboratory tests reveal elevated levels of serum creatine kinase and aldolase. Her symptoms improve significantly when she is treated with corticosteroids. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ",Duchenne's muscular dystrophy,Myasthenia gravis,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,Aseptic necrosis of the femoral head,Polymyositis,,5,"The patient described has an inflammatory myopathy of the polymyositis/dermatomyositis group. Proximal muscle involvement and elevation of serum muscle enzymes such as creatine kinase and aldolase are characteristic. Corticosteroids are the accepted treatment of choice. It is extremely unlikely that Duchenne's muscular dystrophy would present after age 30. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, an abnormal neurologic examination with findings of upper motor neuron dysfunction is characteristic. Patients with myasthenia gravis characteristically have optic involvement, often presenting as diplopia. The predominant symptom of aseptic necrosis of the femoral head is pain rather than proximal muscle weakness. Elevated muscle enzymes are not characteristic.  ",,

He drinks 36 beers/week. An examination and laboratory tests, including a CBC and serum liver enzymes, are within normal limits. Which one of the following is true regarding the diagnosis? ",The most likely diagnosis is alcoholic liver disease,The most likely diagnosis is Dubin-Johnson syndrome,The most likely diagnosis is Gilbert syndrome,Ultrasonography of the liver and gallbladder are necessary to make a diagnosis,,,3,"Gilbert syndrome is a hereditary disease characterized by indirect hyperbilirubinemia caused by impaired glucuronyl transferase activity. The workup includes studies to exclude hemolysis (CBC, reticulocyte count, and haptoglobin) and liver disease (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and prothrombin time). Alcoholic liver disease is associated with a greater elevation of AST than of ALT. Dubin-Johhnson syndrome is a benign liver disease distinguished by direct or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Imaging studies are not required to confirm Gilbert syndrome; such studies are more useful for conditions involving conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Other causes of indirect hyperbilirubinemia include hematoma, infection, cardiac disease, rhabdomyolysis, living at high altitude, thyrotoxicosis, and some medications.",,

She describes her periods as heavy, and says they occur once a month and last for 7 days, with no spotting in between. She has never been sexually active and does not expect this to change in the foreseeable future. An abdominal examination is normal. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step?",A pelvic examination,Ultrasonography,A TSH level,Naproxen prior to and during menses,,,4,"This patient is experiencing primary dysmenorrhea, a common finding in adolescents, with estimates of prevalence ranging from 20% to 90%. Because symptoms started at a rather young age and she has pain only during menses, endometriosis or other significant pelvic pathology is unlikely. An infection is doubtful, considering that she is not sexually active and that symptoms have been present for 2 years. In the absence of red flags, a pelvic examination, laboratory evaluation, and pelvic ultrasonography are not necessary at this time. However, they can be ordered if she does not respond to simple treatment. NSAIDs such as naproxen have a slight effect on platelet function, but because they inhibit prostaglandin synthesis they actually decrease the volume of menstrual flow and lessen the discomfort of pelvic cramping. Acetaminophen would have no effect on prostaglandins.  ",,

Which one of the following would you recommend at this time in addition to continued breastfeeding? ",Iron supplementation,Vitamin D supplementation,A multivitamin,8 oz of water daily,4 oz of cereal daily,,2,"Although breast milk is the ideal source of nutrition for healthy term infants, supplementation with 400 IU/day of vitamin D is recommended beginning at 2 months of age and continuing until the child is consuming at least 500 mL/day of formula or milk containing vitamin D (SOR B). The purpose of supplementation is to prevent rickets. Unless the baby is anemic or has other deficiencies, neither iron nor a multivitamin is necessary. Parents often mistakenly think babies need additional water, which can be harmful because it decreases milk intake and can cause electrolyte disturbances. Cereal should not be started until 4 months of age.",,

You tell him that recent evidence shows that,NRT usually doubles a smoker's chance of quitting,NRT must be tapered off,NRT should be used for at least 6 months to be effective,nicotine patches are the most effective form of NRT,using combinations of NRT reduces the likelihood that a relapsed smoker will quit,,1,"A Cochrane meta-analysis of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) found that it almost doubles a smoker's chances of quitting (SOR A). There was no benefit to tapering NRT as compared to abrupt discontinuation. Treatment for 8 weeks was as effective as a longer course. No one type of NRT is significantly more effective, but combining several types may aid a relapsed smoker in his or her next quit attempt.",,

Delayed gastric emptying has a direct effect on glucose metabolism, in addition to being a means of reducing the severity of postprandial hyperglycemia. In a clinical trial of exenatide, nausea occurred in 57% of patients and vomiting occurred in 19%, which led to the cessation of treatment in about one-third of patients.

The greater the duration and anatomic extent of involvement, the greater the risk. Initial colonoscopy for patients with pancolitis of 8&ndash;10 years' duration (regardless of the patient's age) should be followed up with surveillance examinations every 1&ndash;2 years, even if the disease is in remission. All of the other options listed are features typically associated with Crohn's disease. Virtually all patients with UC have rectal involvement, even if that is the only area affected. In Crohn's disease, rectal involvement is variable. Noncontinuous and transmural inflammation are also more common with Crohn's disease. Transmural inflammation can lead to eventual fistula formation, which is not seen in UC.  ",,

5463,1,Medicine,"A 22-year-old competitive cross-country skier presents with a complaint of not being able to perform as well as she expects. She has been training hard, but says she seems to get short of breath more quickly than she should. She also coughs frequently while exercising. A review of systems is otherwise negative. Her family history is negative for cardiac or pulmonary diseases. Her physical examination is completely normal, and pulmonary function tests obtained before and after bronchodilator use are normal. After you discuss your findings with the patient, she acknowledges that her expectations may be too high, but can think of no other cause for her problem. Which one of the following would be the next reasonable step?  ",An echocardiogram to look for cardiomyopathy or valvular dysfunction,Counseling regarding competition stress and athlete burnout syndrome,A sports medicine consultation to evaluate her training regimen,A trial of inhaled albuterol (Proventil) for exercise-induced bronchospasm,,,4,"Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is a very common and underdiagnosed condition in athletes. It is defined as a 10% lowering of FEV1 when challenged with exercise. The exercise required to cause bronchoconstriction is 58 minutes at 80% of maximal oxygen consumption. EIB is much more common in high-ventilation sports, such as track and cross-country skiing. It is also more common in winter sports, because of the inspiration of cold, dry air. In some studies the incidence among cross-country skiers is as high as 50%, and 40% of those who have positive tests for bronchospasm are unaware of the problem. A physical examination, as well as pulmonary function tests at rest and before and after bronchodilators, will be normal unless there is underlying asthma. Among athletes with EIB, 10% will not have asthma. Bronchoprovocative testing can be ordered, but if it is not available a trial with an albuterol inhaler is reasonable. Cardiomyopathy or valvular dysfunction not found during the physical examination is possible, but much less likely. Psychological stresses are also a possible etiology, but should not receive undue attention, especially when simple questioning is not productive and more likely diagnoses have not been ruled out. Poor training methods are also possible, but in a competitive athlete this is not the most likely cause.  ",,
5464,4,Pediatrics,"In a child, which one of the following is most likely to improve adherence to a chronic medication regimen?",Adding a favorite flavor to bitter liquid medications,More frequent dosing of daily medication,Having only one person from the health-care team discuss the medication regimen with the patient and his parents,Advising the parents to avoid giving rewards for following the regimen,Putting the parents in complete control of the dosing schedule,,1,"A number of useful strategies for promoting adherence to a chronic medical regimen can be employed in children. Adding flavors to unpleasant tasting medicines is helpful (SOR B). Chocolate flavoring is especially useful for masking the taste of bitter medications. Using medications that are given only once or twice a day is associated with compliance rates of greater than 70% (SOR B). Consistent advice given by multiple members of the health-care team reinforces the importance of following a medication regimen. Parental use of rewards for children who take their medicine properly helps improve adherence. Involving children in decisions concerning their care gives them a sense of control and improves adherence. Other strategies for improving adherence include patient handouts, keeping financial costs in mind when prescribing, advising patients to incorporate dosing into daily routines such as meals, keeping tally sheets, and using visual reminders such as notes on the refrigerator.

He experienced short runs of ventricular tachycardia during his hospitalization, and echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction of 40% at the time of discharge, with no symptoms of heart failure. He has a history of depression in the past. His current symptoms include depressed mood, sleep disturbance, feelings of hopelessness, and anhedonia. He denies suicidal ideation. Which one of the following would be most appropriate at this point?",Low-dose amitriptyline at bedtime,Sertraline (Zoloft),Referral for electroconvulsive therapy,Referral for intense interpersonal psychotherapy,,,2,"Several studies have demonstrated that SSRIs are safe and effective in treating depression in patients with coronary disease, particularly those with a history of previous episodes of depression. Medications have performed significantly better than intensive interpersonal psychotherapy in this setting. Electroconvulsive therapy is not considered first-line therapy in the absence of severe symptoms. While it may be effective for sleep disturbance, amitriptyline has potential cardiac side effects and is unlikely to be effective for the treatment of depression in low doses.",,

Smoking cessation is the single most important therapeutic intervention in patients with this condition and should be a priority of care. No existing medications have been shown to modify the long-term decline in lung function that is typical of COPD, but smoking cessation does prevent this decline. Long-term use of oxygen in COPD patients who also have chronic, severe hypoxia (&lt;88% saturation) can improve quality of life and prolong survival; however, oxygen cannot prevent further decline in lung function. Long-term use of oral corticosteroids is discouraged because of an unfavorable risk-to-benefit ratio.",,

He says that his bladder will feel full when he needs to urinate, but the urine stream is weak and his bladder does not feel as if it has emptied completely. The symptoms have become increasingly severe over the past week. Other symptoms include upper respiratory congestion for 3 days which he has treated with an over-the-counter decongestant with some relief, constipation with no passage of stool in the past 9 days, and increasing low back pain incompletely relieved with ibuprofen, with associated weakness in both legs. Examination shows a healthy-appearing male who is moderately overweight. He is afebrile and vital signs are normal. There is no abdominal tenderness and no masses are detected. A rectal examination reveals a large amount of hard stool in the rectum; a markedly enlarged (4+), boggy, tender prostate gland; laxity of the anal sphincter; and numbness in the perianal area. Urinalysis shows trace protein and 10&ndash;20 WBCs/hpf. Ultrasonography shows a post-void residual volume of 250 mL (normal for age &lt;100). Which one of the following must be done urgently in this patient?  ",Foley catheterization,Hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics,"Digital disimpaction of the rectum, and Fleet enemas until clear",MRI of the lumbosacral spine,,,4,"The differential diagnosis of urinary retention in the elderly is broad. While most causes are benign and readily treated, the physician must be vigilant in looking for conditions that require urgent intervention. This patient presents with many possible causes of urinary retention, with the most common being benign prostatic hyperplasia. Acute prostatitis, especially in a male with an enlarged prostate, is another relatively common reason for obstructive symptoms. This patient's physical examination and abnormal urinalysis support this diagnosis, but his normal vital signs and lack of fever suggest he can be treated with an oral fluroquinolone and does not require hospital admission for intravenous therapy. Medications such as oral decongestants can contribute to urinary retention in men with enlarged prostate glands, and should be used with caution and discontinued if obstructive symptoms occur. Obstipation (severe constipation caused by intestinal obstruction) with stool impaction is another relatively common reason for urinary retention in the elderly and can be treated with manual disimpaction and enemas. In this patient, the presence of increasing low back pain and leg weakness, and the findings of anal sphincter laxity and numbness in the perianal area on examination, suggest the presence of a serious neurologic etiology such as cauda equina syndrome. Urgent diagnosis and treatment are necessary to reduce morbidity, and MRI should be performed immediately. The presence of a mildly elevated post-void residual is not an indication for urgent decompression with a Foley catheter.  ",,

A complete metabolic panel and urinalysis reveal a serum creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL (N 0.61.5) and 2+ protein in the urine. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate initial treatment? ",ACE inhibitors,Aldosterone antagonists,Beta - Blockers,Calcium channel blockers,Diuretics,,1,"Although JNC-7 guidelines recommend a diuretic as the initial pharmacologic agent for most patients with hypertension, the presence of compelling indications may indicate the need for treatment with antihypertensive agents that demonstrate a particular benefit in primary or secondary prevention. JNC-7 guidelines recommend ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for hypertensive patients with chronic kidney disease (SOR A). First-line therapy for proteinuric kidney disease includes an ACEI or an ARB. Because these drugs can cause elevations in creatinine and potassium, these levels should be monitored. A serum creatinine level as much as 35% above baseline is acceptable in patients taking these agents and is not a reason to withhold treatment unless hyperkalemia develops. If an ACEI or an ARB does not control the hypertension, the addition of a diuretic or a calcium channel blocker may be required. The combination of ACEIs and diuretics may be used to control hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus, heart failure, or high coronary disease risk, as well as post myocardial infarction. Calcium channel blockers are recommended for managing hypertension in patients with diabetes or high coronary disease risk. -Blockers are useful as part of combination therapy in patients with hypertension and heart failure, or post myocardial infarction.

The only significant findings on examination are a low-grade fever and subjective tenderness with palpation over the right maxillary sinus. Which one of the following treatments is most supported by current evidence? ,Antihistamines,Oral decongestants,Topical vasoconstrictor sprays,Oral analgesics,Nasal lavage,,4,"Although oral antibiotics are overwhelmingly prescribed as initial treatment in acute sinusitis, it has been shown that the majority of acute illnesses are viral in origin and that 98% of cases will resolve spontaneously. Analgesics are considered the mainstay of therapy for acute sinusitis, according to evidence-based recommendations (SOR A). Other treatments should be considered if symptoms are prolonged (7 days) or severe (two or more localizing symptoms or signs of serious bacterial complications). There is little evidence of effectiveness for antihistamines, oral decongestants, or vasoconstrictor sprays.

Option E is the ratio of false-negative tests to false-positive tests, a meaningless ratio. The predictive values of positive and negative tests are extremely important characteristics of a screening test. Determination of these values requires knowledge of the prevalence of the disease in the population screened, as well as the sensitivity, specificity, and false-positive and false-negative rates. Since the prevalence of most diseases is low, the percentage of those with a positive test (the predictive value of a positive test) is relatively low, even when sensitivity and specificity are high. When prevalence is low, however, the predictive value of a negative test is very high and may approach 100%.",,

This patient probably has",a stress fracture,a herniated nucleus pulposus at L5 or S1,plantar fasciitis,diabetic neuropathy,tarsal tunnel syndrome,,5,"Entrapment of the posterior tibial nerve or its branches as the nerve courses behind the medial malleolus results in a neuritis known as tarsal tunnel syndrome. Causes of compression within the tarsal tunnel include varices of the posterior tibial vein, tenosynovitis of the flexor tendon, structural alteration of the tunnel secondary to trauma, and direct compression of the nerve. Pronation of the foot causes pain and paresthesias in the medial aspect of the ankle and heel, and sometimes the plantar surface of the foot. The usual site for a stress fracture is the shaft of the second, third, or fourth metatarsals. A herniated nucleus pulposus would produce reflex and sensory changes. Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain in runners and often presents with pain at the beginning of the workout. The pain decreases during running only to recur afterward. Diabetic neuropathy is usually bilateral and often produces paresthesias and burning at night, with absent or decreased deep tendon reflexes.  ",,

Which one of the following is INCREASED in geriatric patients?,Drug absorption,Glomerular filtration rate,Lean body mass,Volume of distribution of water-soluble compounds such as digoxin,Percentage of body fat,,5,"The physiologic changes that accompany aging result in altered pharmacokinetics. Drug distribution is one important factor. In older persons, there is a relative increase in body fat and a relative decrease in lean body mass, which causes increased distribution of fat-soluble drugs such as diazepam. This also increases the elimination half-life of such medications. The volume of distribution of water-soluble compounds such as digoxin is decreased in older patients, which means a smaller dose is required to reach a given target plasma concentration. There is a predictable reduction in glomerular filtration rate and tubular secretion with aging, which causes decreased clearance of medications in the geriatric population. The absorption of drugs changes little with advancing age. All of these changes are important factors in choosing dosages of medications in the elderly population.",,

Category A drugs have been shown in controlled studies to pose no risk. At present there are no category A antibiotics. Most fall into categories B and C, with category B drugs thought to be relatively safe in pregnancy. When possible, a category B antibiotic should be chosen for treatment of a pregnant patient. Category C drugs have unknown fetal risk with no adequate human studies, and the possibility of risks and benefits must be considered before prescribing them for pregnant women. Category D drugs show some evidence for fetal risk; although there may be times when use of these drugs is necessary, they should not be used unless there is a very serious or life-threatening situation. Category X drugs have proven fetal risk and are contraindicated in pregnancy. Of the drugs listed, only nitrofurantoin is in category B. The others are all category C drugs. The FDA is currently in the process of revising their classification and labeling for drugs in pregnancy and lactation.  ",,

Dizziness on first arising, dizziness with rolling over in bed, and dizziness with nausea and vomiting are consistent with peripheral causes of vertigo, such as benign positional vertigo. Dizziness that occurs after a couple of minutes of hyperventilation suggests a psychogenic cause.",,
5480,1,Medicine,Which one of the following is most appropriate for the initial treatment of claudication? ,Regular exercise,Chelation,Vasodilating agents,Warfarin (Coumadin),,,1,"Claudication is exercise-induced lower-extremity pain that is caused by ischemia and relieved by rest. It affects 10% of persons over 70 years of age. However, up to 90% of patients with peripheral vascular disease are asymptomatic. Initial treatment should consist of vigorous risk factor modification and exercise. Patients who follow an exercise regimen can increase their walking time by 150%. A supervised program may produce better results. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, and hyperlipidemia. Unconventional treatments such as chelation have not been shown to be effective. Vasodilating agents are of no benefit. There is no evidence that anticoagulants such as aspirin have a role in the treatment of claudication.  ",,
5481,1,Medicine,"A 72-year-old white male in otherwise good health complains of generalized pruritus that worsens in the winter. The itching is most intense after he bathes. He recently noticed a rash on his abdomen and legs as well. On examination you note poorly defined red, scaly plaques with fine fissures on the abdomen. No eruption is present at other pruritic sites. Which one of the following is the most likely cause of this problem? ",Stasis dermatitis,Lichen simplex chronicus,Xerosis,Rosacea,Candidiasis,,3,"Xerosis is a pathologic dryness of the skin that is especially prominent in the elderly. It is probably caused by minor abnormalities in maturation of the epidermis that lead to decreased hydration of the superficial portion of the stratum corneum. Xerosis often intensifies in winter, because of the lower humidity and cold temperatures. Stasis dermatitis, due to chronic venous insufficiency, appears as a reddish-brown discoloration of the lower leg. Lichen simplex chronicus, the end result of habitual scratching or rubbing, usually presents as isolated hyperpigmented, edematous lesions, which become scaly and thickened in the center. Rosacea is most often seen on the face as an erythematous, acneiform eruption, which flushes easily and is surrounded by telangiectasia. Candidiasis is an opportunistic infection favoring areas that are warm, moist, and macerated, such as the perianal and inguinal folds, inframammary folds, axillae, interdigital areas, and corners of the mouth.

Tumor size and lymph node involvement are the main factors to take into account. Other prognostic parameters (tumor grade, histologic type, and lymphatic or blood vessel involvement) have been proposed as important variables, but most microscopic findings other than lymph node involvement correlate poorly with prognosis.

Which one of the patient's current medications should be discontinued? ,Lisinopril (Zestril),Pioglitazone (Actos),Glipizide (Glucotrol),Metoprolol (Toprol-XL),Repaglinide (Prandin),,2,"According to the current guidelines, thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are associated with fluid retention, and their use can be complicated by the development of heart failure. Caution is necessary when prescribing TZDs in patients with known heart failure or other heart diseases, those with preexisting edema, and those on concurrent insulin therapy (SOR C). Older patients can be treated with the same drug regimens as younger patients, but special care is required when prescribing and monitoring drug therapy. Metformin is often contraindicated because of renal insufficiency or heart failure. Sulfonylureas and other insulin secretagogues can cause hypoglycemia. Insulin can also cause hypoglycemia, and injecting it requires good visual and motor skills and cognitive ability on the part of the patient or a caregiver. TZDs should not be used in patients with heart failure.  ",,
5486,1,Medicine,"A 75-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a several-hour history of back pain in the interscapular region. His medical history includes a previous myocardial infarction (MI) several years ago, a history of cigarette smoking until the time of the MI, and hypertension that is well controlled with hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril). The patient appears anxious, but all pulses are intact. His blood pressure is 170/110 mm Hg and his pulse rate is 110 beats/min. An EKG shows evidence of an old inferior wall MI but no acute changes. A chest radiograph shows a widened mediastinum and a normal aortic arch, and CT of the chest shows a dissecting aneurysm of the descending aorta that is distal to the proximal abdominal aorta but does not involve the renal arteries. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient? ",Immediate surgical intervention,Arteriography of the aorta,Intravenous nitroprusside (Nitropress),A nitroglycerin drip,Intravenous labetalol (Trandate),,5,"Patients with thoracic aneurysms often present without symptoms. With dissecting aneurysms, however, the presenting symptom depends on the location of the aneurysm. Aneurysms can compress or distort nearby structures, resulting in branch vessel compression or embolization of peripheral arteries from a thrombus within the aneurysm. Leakage of the aneurysm will cause pain, and rupture can occur with catastrophic results, including severe pain, hypotension, shock, and death. Aneurysms in the ascending aorta may present with acute heart failure brought about by aortic regurgitation from aortic root dilatation and distortion of the annulus. Other presenting findings may include hoarseness, myocardial ischemia, paralysis of a hemidiaphragm, wheezing, coughing, hemoptysis, dyspnea, dysphagia, or superior vena cava syndrome. This diagnosis should be suspected in individuals in their sixties and seventies with the same risk factors as those for coronary artery disease, particularly smokers. A chest radiograph may show widening of the mediastinum, enlargement of the aortic knob, or tracheal displacement. Transesophageal echocardiography can be very useful when dissection is suspected. CT with intravenous contrast is very accurate for showing the size, extent of disease, pressure of leakage, and nearby pathology. Angiography is the preferred method for evaluation and is best for evaluation of branch vessel pathology. MR angiography provides noninvasive multiplanar image reconstruction, but does have limited availability and lower resolution than traditional contrast angiography. Acute dissection of the ascending aorta is a surgical emergency, but dissections confined to the descending aorta are managed medically unless the patient demonstrates progression or continued hemorrhage into the retroperitoneal space or pleura. Initial management should reduce the systolic blood pressure to 100120 mm Hg or to the lowest level tolerated. The use of a beta-blocker such as propranolol or labetalol to get the heart rate below 60 beats/min should be first-line therapy. If the systolic blood pressure remains over 100 mm Hg, intravenous nitroprusside should be added. Vasodilation will induce reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system, causing increased ventricular contraction and increased shear stress on the aorta. For descending dissections, surgery is indicated only for complications such as occlusion of a major aortic branch, continued extension or expansion of the dissection, or rupture (which may be manifested by persistent or recurrent pain).

5487,4,Pediatrics,"An asymptomatic 3-year-old male presents for a routine check-up. On examination you notice a systolic heart murmur. It is heard best in the lower precordium and has a low, short tone similar to a plucked string or kazoo. It does not radiate to the axillae or the back and seems to decrease with inspiration. The remainder of the examination is normal. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ",Eisenmenger's syndrome,Mitral stenosis,Peripheral pulmonic stenosis,Still's murmur,Venous hum,,4,"There are several benign murmurs of childhood that have no association with physiologic or anatomic abnormalities. Of these, Still's murmur best fits the murmur described. The cause of Still's murmur is unknown, but it may be due to vibrations in the chordae tendinae, semilunar valves, or ventricular wall. A venous hum consists of a continuous low-pitched murmur caused by collapse of the jugular veins and their subsequent fluttering, and it worsens with inspiration or diastole. The murmur of physiologic peripheral pulmonic stenosis (PPPS) is caused by physiologic changes in the newborn's pulmonary vessels. PPPS is a systolic murmur heard loudest in the axillae bilaterally that usually disappears by 9 months of age. Mitral stenosis causes a diastolic murmur, and Eisenmenger's syndrome involves multiple abnormalities of the heart that cause significant signs and symptoms, including shortness of breath, cyanosis, and organomegaly, which should become apparent from a routine history and examination.",,
5488,1,Medicine,A 75-year-old female is admitted to the hospital with a change in mental status. The initial workup includes a chemistry profile that reveals a plasma potassium level of 6.4 mEq/L (N 3.75.2). Which one of the following should be given now to rapidly lower the plasma potassium level? , Acute hemodialysis,Corticosteroids,Albuterol,Sodium polystyrene sulfonate,0.45% saline,,3,"Severe hyperkalemia (6.0 mEq/L) requires aggressive treatment. Calcium gluconate has no effect on the plasma potassium level, but it should be given first, as it rapidly stabilizes the membranes of cardiac myocytes, reducing the risk of cardiac dysrhythmias. Therapies that translocate potassium from the serum to the intracellular space should be instituted next, as they can quickly (albeit temporarily) lower the plasma concentration of potassium. These interventions include sodium bicarbonate, glucose with insulin, and albuterol. Total body potassium can be lowered with sodium polystyrene sulfonate, but this takes longer to affect the plasma potassium level than translocation methods. In the most severe cases, acute hemodialysis can be instituted.",,

Significant postoperative pulmonary complications include atelectasis, pneumonia, respiratory failure, and exacerbation of underlying chronic lung disease. Risk factors for postoperative pulmonary complications can be divided into patient-related factors, procedure-related factors, and laboratory factors. Patient-related risk factors include advanced age, functional dependence, COPD, and heart failure. Of these, advanced age confers the greatest risk, with risk beginning to increase after age 50. One study found an odds ratio of 5.63 for those age 80 and above. Procedure-related risk factors include aortic aneurysm repair, nonresective thoracic surgery, abdominal surgery, neurosurgery, emergency surgery, general anesthesia, head and neck surgery, vascular surgery, and prolonged surgery. The only laboratory predictor supported by good evidence is a serum albumin level 30 g/L.  ",,

Which one of the following should be discontinued for 3 months before repeat laboratory evaluation and treatment? ",Lithium,Furosemide (Lasix),Raloxifene (Evista),Calcium carbonate,Vitamin D,,1,"Lithium therapy can elevate calcium levels by elevating parathyroid hormone secretion from the thyroid gland. This duplicates the laboratory findings seen with mild primary hyperparathyroidism. If possible, lithium should be discontinued for 3 months before reevaluation (SOR C). This is most important for avoiding unnecessary parathyroid surgery. Vitamin D and calcium supplementation could contribute to hypercalcemia in rare instances, but they would not cause elevation of parathyroid hormone. Raloxifene has actually been shown to mildly reduce elevated calcium levels, and furosemide is used with saline infusions to lower significantly elevated calcium levels.  ",,

",Evaluation for a source of blood loss,Hemoglobin electrophoresis to screen for thalassemia,Stopping the methotrexate and beginning an alternative treatment for rheumatoid arthritis,No further evaluation,,,1,"Anemia of chronic disease is characterized by the underproduction of red cells, due to hypoferremia caused by the uptake of iron by the reticuloendothelial system. Total-body iron stores are increased but the iron in storage is not available for red cell production. This anemia is normochromic and normocytic, and is associated with a reduction in iron, transferrin, and transferrin saturation. Ferritin is either normal or increased, reflecting both the increased iron within the reticuloendothelial system and increases due to immune activation (acute phase reactant). In iron deficiency anemia, total-body iron levels are low, leading to hypochromia and microcytosis, low iron levels, increased transferrin levels, and reduced ferritin levels. This patient's anemia is most likely multifactorial, with anemia of chronic disease and drug effects playing a role. However, she also has iron deficiency, and searching for a source of blood loss would be important.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy helps change incorrect beliefs and attitudes about sleep (e.g., unrealistic expectations, misconceptions, amplifying consequences of sleeplessness). Techniques include reattribution training (goal setting and planning coping responses), decatastrophizing (balancing anxious automatic thoughts), reappraisal, and attention shifting. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is recommended as an effective, nonpharmacologic treatment for chronic insomnia (SOR A). Many herbs and dietary supplements have been promoted as sleep aids. However, with the exceptions of melatonin and valerian, there is insufficient evidence of benefit. Alcohol acts directly on GABA-gated channels, reducing sleep-onset latency, but it increases wakefulness after sleep onset and suppresses rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. It also has the potential for abuse and should not be used as a sleep aid. Moderate-intensity exercise can improve sleep, but exercising just before bedtime can delay sleep onset.  ",,

What is the most likely cause of his hypercalcemia? ",Renal failure,Hyperparathyroidism,Milk alkali syndrome,Sarcoidosis,,,2,"Many patients have mild hyperparathyroidism that becomes evident only with an added calcium load. Thiazide diuretics reduce calcium excretion and can cause overt symptoms in a patient whose hyperparathyroidism would otherwise have remained asymptomatic. The finding of a normal parathyroid hormone (PTH) level in a patient with hypercalcemia is diagnostic for hyperparathyroidism, since PTH should be suppressed in the presence of elevated calcium. Symptomatic hypercalcemia causes dehydration because of both intestinal symptoms and diuresis. Reversible renal insufficiency can result, and can become permanent if it is long-standing and severe. Conversely, renal failure usually causes hypocalcemia, but can cause hypercalcemia resulting from tertiary hyperparathyroidism. This develops after severe hyperphosphatemia and vitamin D deficiency eventually produce hypersecretion of PTH. This patient's renal insufficiency is not severe enough to cause tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Milk alkali syndrome is hypercalcemia resulting from a chronic overdose of calcium carbonate, and is becoming more common as more patients take calcium and vitamin D supplements. In milk alkali syndrome, and other causes of hypercalcemia such as sarcoidosis, the PTH level is appropriately suppressed.  ",,

The etiology is varied, but includes dental malocclusion, bruxism (teeth grinding), anxiety, stress disorders, and, rarely, rheumatoid arthritis. Dental occlusion problems, once thought to be the primary etiology, are not more common in persons with TMJ disorder. While dental splints have been commonly recommended, the evidence for and against their use is insufficient to make a recommendation either way. Physical therapy modalities such as iontophoresis or phonophoresis may benefit some patients, but there is no clearly preferred treatment. Radiologic imaging is unnecessary in the vast majority of patients, and should therefore be reserved for chronic or severe cases.

The treatment of choice in this condition is to remove the bloody fluid and re-expand the associated lung. This therapy is felt to decrease any ongoing blood loss by having the lung pleura put a direct barrier over the site that is bleeding. It also prevents the development of empyema or fibrosis, which could occur if the blood were to remain.Note: Although not contraindicated, drainage of hemothorax or any pleural effusion in an individual with a coagulopathy should be performed with great care.

5506,1,Medicine,"A 35-year-old female presents with pain in her neck, back, and shoulder, as well as a complaint of poor sleep and fatigue. For the last 6 months she has experienced burning in her low back that radiates to her buttocks, and she feels that her joints are swollen even though there is no objective evidence of this. She also experiences morning stiffness that improves as the day progresses. A physical examination is unremarkable with the exception of palpation of 14 different tender points above and below the diaphragm, including the upper border of the trapezius muscle, the second rib space 3 cm lateral to the sternal border bilaterally, both lateral epicondyles, the upper outer quadrants of both gluteal muscles, and the radial fat pad of both knees. Laboratory tests, including a CBC, a chemistry profile, thyroid function tests, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate, all are within normal limits. Which one of the following would be the most helpful treatment for this patient?  ",Massage therapy,NSAIDs,Trigger-point injections,Corticosteroids,Cognitive-behavior therapy,,5,"The etiology of fibromyalgia remains unknown, but it is a common condition that is underdiagnosed. It is much more common in women than in men; additional risk factors include being divorced, having a low income level, and not completing high school. The pathogenesis may be related to central sensitization and dysregulation of the hypothalamic (pituitary) adrenal axis. Commonly associated symptoms include headache (often migraine in type), anxiety, depression, and dizziness. The diagnosis is specific, and requires the finding of at least 11 tender points in 18 possible specific anatomic locations, with the pain occurring both above and below the waist on both sides of the body for at least 3 months. There is strong evidence for the effectiveness of both pharmacologic therapies such as cyclobenzaprine and nonpharmacologic therapies such as aerobic exercise, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and multidisciplinary approaches that include patient education and exercise. The evidence of effectiveness is weak for chiropractic therapy, electrotherapy, massage therapy, and ultrasound. There is no known benefit from corticosteroids, opioids, thyroid hormone, NSAIDs, melatonin, flexibility exercises, or trigger-point injections.  ",,

These include headache in an unacclimatized person who recently arrived at an elevation &gt;2500 m (8200 ft), plus the presence of one or more of the following: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, dizziness, or fatigue. The patient's condition then deteriorated to high-altitude cerebral edema, defined as the onset of ataxia and/or altered consciousness in someone with acute mountain sickness. The management of choice is a combination of descent and supplemental oxygen. Often, a descent of only 500&ndash;1000 m (1600&ndash;3300 ft) will lead to resolution of acute mountain sickness. Simulated descent with a portable hyperbaric chamber also is effective, but descent should not be delayed while awaiting helicopter delivery. If descent and/or administration of oxygen is not possible, medical therapy with dexamethasone and/or acetazolamide may reduce the severity of symptoms. Nifedipine has also been shown to be helpful in cases of high-altitude pulmonary edema where descent and/or supplemental oxygen is unavailable.",,

It is characterized by anterior knee pain, particularly with activities that overload the joint, such as stair climbing, running, and squatting. Patients complain of popping, catching, stiffness, and giving way. On examination there will be a positive J sign, with the patella moving from a medial to a lateral location when the knee is fully extended from the 90 position. This is caused by an imbalance in the medial and lateral forces acting on the patella. Locking is not characteristic of patellofemoral pain syndrome, so loose bodies or a meniscal tear should be considered if this is found.",,
5512,3,PMCH,The parents of three children ask your advice about the need for fluoride supplementation in order to prevent tooth decay. Which one of the following is true regarding current guidelines for fluoride supplementation?,It is not recommended due to potential fluoride toxicity,Dental fluoride varnish is too toxic for routine use,Oral fluoride supplementation is recommended if the primary drinking water source is low in fluoride,Fluoridated toothpaste provides adequate protection if used as soon as the child has teeth,The need for fluoride supplementation is determined by serum fluoride levels,,3,"The current recommendation is that children over the age of 6 months receive oral fluoride supplementation if the primary drinking water source is deficient in fluoride. They cite fair evidence (B recommendation) that such supplementation reduces the incidence of dental caries and conclude that the overall benefit outweighs the potential harm from dental fluorosis. Dental fluorosis is chiefly a cosmetic staining of the teeth, is uncommon with currently recommended doses, and has no other functional or physiologic consequences. Fluoridated toothpaste can cause fluorosis in children younger than 2 years of age, and is therefore not recommended in this age group. By itself it does not reliably prevent tooth decay. Fluoride varnish, applied by a dental or medical professional, is another treatment option to prevent caries. It provides longer lasting protection than fluoride rinses, but since it is less concentrated, it may carry a lower risk of fluorosis than other forms of supplementation. Oral fluoride supplementation for children over the age of 6 months is based not only on age but on the concentration of fluoride in the primary source of drinking water, whether it be tap water or bottled water. Most water supplies in Canada are adequately fluoridated, but concentrations vary. Fluoride concentrations in bottled water vary widely. If the concentration is greater than 0.6 ppm no supplementation is needed, and if given, may result in fluorosis. Lower concentrations of fluoride may indicate the need for partial or full-dose supplementation.  ",,
5513,1,Medicine,A 55-year-old male has heart failure. He becomes dyspneic with significant exertion. His only medication is an ACE inhibitor. Which one of the following additional medications has been shown to improve longevity in this situation? ,Digitalis,Warfarin (Coumadin),Beta-Blockers,Amiodarone (Cordarone),Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers,,3," -Blockers are recommended to reduce mortality in symptomatic patients with heart failure (SOR A). Because polypharmacy can reduce compliance, the role that digoxin will ultimately play in heart failure is unclear. The Digitalis Investigation Group study revealed a trend toward increased mortality among women with heart failure who were taking digoxin, but digoxin levels were higher among women than men. There is no evidence that warfarin decreases mortality in patients with heart failure. There is also no evidence that amiodarone decreases mortality from heart failure in patients with no history of atrial fibrillation. Calcium channel blockers should be used with caution in patients with heart failure because they can cause peripheral vasodilation, decreased heart rate, decreased cardiac contractility, and decreased cardiac conduction.

Secondary cases usually occur within 4 days of the initial case. Therefore, prophylactic treatment should begin as soon as possible. Rifampin has been shown to be 90% effective in eliminating meningococcus from the nasopharynx. Other appropriate chemoprophylactic agents include minocycline and ciprofloxacin. Even high doses of penicillin may not eradicate nasopharyngeal meningococci. Prednisone has no place in chemoprophylaxis.

Just after arriving at your office he passes bloody stool. A physical examination reveals normal vital signs, and guarding and tenderness in the right lower quadrant. A rectal examination shows blood on the examining finger. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ",Appendicitis,Viral gastroenteritis,Midgut volvulus,Meckel's diverticulum,Necrotizing enterocolitis,,4,"Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital abnormality of the small intestine. It is prone to bleeding because it may contain heterotopic gastric mucosa. Abdominal pain, distention, and vomiting may develop if obstruction has occurred, and the presentation may mimic appendicitis. Children with appendicitis have right lower quadrant pain, abdominal tenderness, guarding, and vomiting, but not rectal bleeding. With acute viral gastroenteritis, vomiting usually precedes diarrhea (usually without blood) by several hours, and abdominal pain is typically mild and nonfocal with no localized tenderness. The incidence of midgut volvulus peaks during the first month of life, but it can present anytime in childhood. Volvulus may present in one of three ways: as a sudden onset of bilious vomiting and abdominal pain in the neonate; as a history of &ldquo;feeding problems&rdquo; with bilious vomiting that now appears to be due to bowel obstruction; or, less commonly, as a failure to thrive with severe feeding intolerance. Necrotizing enterocolitis is typically seen in the neonatal intensive-care unit, occurring in premature infants in their first few weeks of life. The infants are ill, and signs and symptoms include lethargy, irritability, decreased oral intake, abdominal distention, and bloody stools. A plain abdominal film showing pneumatosis intestinalis, caused by gas in the intestinal wall, is diagnostic of this disease.  ",,

A second option is to obtain blood cultures and stool studies, or a chest film if indicated by the history or examination, and spinal fluid studies if empiric antibiotics are to be given. This infant's clinical status did not indicate that any of these additional studies should be performed, and empiric antibiotic treatment is not planned. Observation with no follow-up is an appropriate strategy in nontoxic children, but only if the child is 3&ndash;36 months of age and the temperature is under 39&deg;C. Nontoxic children 3&ndash;36 months of age should be reevaluated in 24&ndash;48 hours if the temperature is over 39&deg;C. Although a positive response to antipyretics has been considered an indication of a lower risk of serious bacterial infection, there is no correlation between fever reduction and the likelihood of such an infection.

Discomfort is common in the neck, shoulders, and hip girdle areas. There is an absence of objective joint swelling, and findings tend to be symmetric. Characteristically, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels are significantly elevated; however, these tests are nonspecific. Occasionally there are mild elevations of liver enzymes, but muscle enzymes, including creatine kinase, are not elevated in this disorder. Elevation of muscle enzymes strongly suggests another diagnosis. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are associated with variable levels of muscle enzyme elevations during the active phases of the disease. Drug-induced myopathies such as those seen with the statin family of cholesterol-lowering medications tend to produce some elevation of muscle enzymes during the course of the disorder. Hypothyroidism is associated with creatine kinase elevation. It should be strongly considered in the patient with unexplained, otherwise asymptomatic creatine kinase elevation found on a routine chemistry profile. Hyperthyroidism may cause muscle disease and loss of muscle, but it is not associated with creatine kinase elevation.  ",,

Additional attempts are very unlikely to succeed, especially with the techniques listed. A loop curette cannot be safely placed behind a foreign body that is close to the tympanic membrane. A round, hard object cannot be grasped with forceps. Acetone can be used to dissolve Styrofoam foreign bodies, but it would not dissolve a plastic bead.",,
5536,2,OBGYN,"A 35-year-old female is planning a second pregnancy. Her last pregnancy was complicated by placental abruption caused by a large fibroid tumor of the uterus, which is still present. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate treatment for the fibroid tumor?",Myomectomy,Myolysis with endometrial ablation,Uterine artery embolization,Observation,,,1,"There are numerous options for the treatment of uterine fibroids. When pregnancy is desired, myomectomy offers the best chance for a successful pregnancy when prior pregnancies have been marked by fibroid-related complications. Endometrial ablation eliminates fertility, and there is a lack of long-term data on fertility after uterine artery embolization. Observation without treatment would not remove the risk for recurrent complications during subsequent pregnancies.",,
5537,1,Medicine,A 36-year-old male presents with pain over the lumbar paraspinal muscles. He says the pain began suddenly while he was shoveling snow. Which one of the following is true regarding this patient's injury? ,Systemic corticosteroids speed recovery,Exercises specific to low back injuries speed recovery,Opioids have significant advantages for symptom relief when compared with NSAIDs or acetaminophen,Continued activity rather than bed rest helps speed recovery,Trigger-point injections are superior to placebo in relieving acute back pain,,4,"Multiple studies have demonstrated that bed rest is detrimental to recovery from low back pain. Patients should be encouraged to remain as active as possible. Exercises designed specifically for the treatment of low back pain have not been shown to be helpful. Neither opioids nor trigger-point injections have shown superiority over placebo, NSAIDs, or acetaminophen in relieving acute back pain. There is no good evidence to suggest that systemic corticosteroids are effective for low back pain with or without sciatica.",,

",Metformin (Glucophage),"Glyburide (DiaBeta, Micronase)",Rosiglitazone (Avandia),Bedtime long-acting insulin (Lantus),Bedtime long-acting insulin and rapid-acting insulin (Novolog) with each meal,,1,"Metformin is widely accepted as the first-line drug for type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is relatively effective, safe, and inexpensive, and has been used widely for many years. Unlike other oral hypoglycemics and insulin, it does not cause weight gain. It should be started at the same time as lifestyle modifications, rather than waiting to see if a diet and exercise regimen alone will work. If metformin is not effective, a sulfonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, or insulin can be added, with the choice based on the severity of the hyperglycemia. ",,

He was able to capably perform these activities in the past. She also tells you that he has reported seeing animals in the room with him that he can describe vividly. He naps for 3 or more hours each day, and stares blankly for long periods of time. He seems almost normal at times, but appears very confused at other times. This confusion seems to come and go randomly. He also has been dreaming a lot, and has fallen more than once recently. His only medication is aspirin, 81 mg/day. On examination the patient walks slowly with a somewhat stooped posture and almost falls when turning around. He has only minimal facial expressiveness. No tremor is noted, and the remainder of the examination is normal. He is able to recall three words out of three, but clock drawing is abnormal.

",Dementia with Lewy bodies,Dementia of Parkinson's disease,Alzheimer's disease,Frontotemporal dementia,Vascular dementia,,1,"This patient has dementia with Lewy bodies, which is the second most common histopathologic type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. He demonstrates typical symptoms and signs of dementia with Lewy bodies, including well-formed hallucinations, vivid dreams, fluctuating cognition, sleep disorder with periods of daytime sleeping, frequent falls, deficits in visuospatial ability (abnormal clock drawing), and REM sleep disorder (vivid dreams). In Alzheimer's disease the predominant early symptom is memory impairment, without the other symptoms found in this patient. In dementia of Parkinson's disease, extrapyramidal symptoms such as tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity precede the onset of memory impairment by more than a year. Patients with vascular dementia have risk factors and symptoms of stroke. Frontotemporal dementia presents with behavioral changes, including disinhibition, or language problems such as various types of aphasia.",,

Which one of the following interventions is most likely to help prevent acute renal failure due to contrast-induced nephropathy? ,Hydration with normal saline and mannitol,Hydration with sodium bicarbonate,Hydration plus a loop diuretic,Administering fenoldopam (Corlopam) prior to the procedure,Infusion of natriuretic peptides prior to the procedure,,2,"Several studies have demonstrated that hydration with sodium bicarbonate reduces the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy in those undergoing cardiac catheterization. Studies of interventions to prevent renal failure in patients at high risk have shown that mannitol plus hydration does not reduce acute renal failure compared to hydration alone. Randomized, controlled trials have shown that fenoldopam does not decrease the need for dialysis or improve survival. One systematic review found that low-osmolality contrast media reduced nephrotoxicity in persons with underlying renal failure requiring studies using contrast. One systematic review and one subsequent randomized, controlled trial found that adding loop diuretics to fluids was not effective and may actually increase the possibility of acute renal failure compared to fluids alone. A large randomized, controlled trial found no significant difference between natriuretic peptides and placebo in preventing acute renal failure induced by contrast media.  ",,

In patients receiving testosterone supplementation, hematocrit should be monitored every 6 months for the first 18 months, then annually. Testosterone should be discontinued if there is more than a 50% rise in hematocrit. Testosterone also causes an increase in lean body mass, and may increase bone density.",,

His pulse rate is 150 beats/min, his systolic blood pressure is palpated at 60 mm Hg, and his respiratory rate is 40/min. His hemoglobin level is 4.0 g/dL because of trauma-related blood loss. His clinical condition is deteriorating despite an infusion of intravenous volume expanders, but the parents are Jehovah's Witnesses and refuse to consent to a blood transfusion because of their religious convictions. Your prognosis is that without a blood transfusion the patient will die. According to medical-legal precedent, which one of the following is correct?",The patient should receive the transfusion regardless of the parents' wishes,The patient can be transfused regardless of the parents' wishes once he becomes asystolic,The parents may refuse the transfusion if they are in agreement,The parents may refuse the transfusion if the patient identifies himself as a Jehovah's Witness,The parents may refuse the transfusion if there is a legally executed advance directive,,1,"The refusal to accept any medical intervention, including life-saving blood transfusions, has been well established for adults who have the ability to definitively communicate their wishes. Also, parents have the power to give or withhold consent to medical treatment on behalf of their children. However, Western courts have deemed that parents cannot refuse emergency, life-saving treatment to children based on these principles: (1) the child's interests outweigh parental rights to refuse medical treatment; (2) parental rights do not give parents life and death authority over their children; and (3) parents do not have an absolute right to refuse medical treatment for their children, if that refusal is regarded as unreasonable.",,

The serum lipase level is more specific and more sensitive than the amylase level. Amylase elevations can be seen with other abdominal illnesses, such as inflammation of the small bowel. Alcoholics with recurrent pancreatitis may have normal serum amylase levels; in such cases, serum lipase would be a better test. There are several scoring systems for the severity of pancreatitis, including the CT severity index, the APACHE II score, the Imrie Scoring System, and Ranson's Criteria, but none of these use serum amylase in their calculation. The elevation of serum amylase does not correspond well with the severity of the pancreatitis.  ",,

The nails appear thickened and distorted. Otherwise she is healthy and has no evidence of systemic disease. Which one of the following would be the most effective initial treatment? ",Soaking in a dilute iodine solution twice daily to cleanse and sterilize the nail beds,Oral amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) for up to 46 weeks,Topical betamethasone dipropionate (Diprolene) applied twice daily to the nail folds for 34 weeks,"Rheumatologic and autoimmune workups for HIV, hepatitis C, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis",,,3,"Chronic paronychia is a common condition in workers whose hands are exposed to chemical irritants or are wet for long periods of time. This patient is an otherwise healthy hairdresser, with frequent exposure to irritants. The patient should be advised to avoid exposure to harsh chemicals and water. In addition, the use of strong topical corticosteroids over several weeks can greatly reduce the inflammation, allowing the nail folds to return to normal and helping the cuticles recover their natural barrier to infection. Soaking in iodine solution would kill bacteria, but would also perpetuate the chronic irritation. Because the condition is related to chemical and water irritation, a prolonged course of antibiotics should not be the first treatment step, and could have serious side effects. There is no need to explore less likely autoimmune causes for nail changes at this time.  ",,

The remainder of his examination is normal; however, a random blood glucose level is 162 mg/dL. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step for this patient? ",Obtain a fasting blood glucose level,"Start metformin (Glucophage), 500 mg daily, and follow up in 4 weeks",Order a hemoglobin A 1c level,Advise the patient to start a weight-loss program and follow up in 4 weeks,,,1,"This patient should have further testing for diabetes mellitus. Current recommendations for diagnosing diabetes mellitus are based on either a fasting glucose level or a 2-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. A casual blood glucose level 200 mg/dL is also diagnostic of diabetes mellitus in patients with symptoms of hyperglycemia. If unequivocal hyperglycemia is not present, the diagnosis must be confirmed by testing on another day. Metformin can be used to treat diabetes mellitus in adolescents, but it is not recommended for prevention in this age group. A diagnosis of diabetes mellitus should be established prior to starting metformin. Hospitalization is not required for this level of blood glucose unless ketoacidosis is present.

Opiates are useful for controlling pain and relieving dyspnea as well. Even small doses of a weaker opiate can reduce the sensation of shortness of breath in cancer patients and in those with heart failure or chronic obstructive lung disease. Addiction is rare in terminally ill patients who are being treated with opiates for pain and/or dyspnea. A medication contract between physician and patient is not required by law and generally is not necessary in this situation, unless diversion of the medication from the patient by the caregivers is suspected. Constipation due to decreased gastrointestinal motility is a very common, if not universal, side effect. Respiratory depression is a late, not early, sign of excessive opiate dosage. Another sign of opiate excess, pinpoint pupils, occurs before respiratory depression and is therefore a useful parameter for monitoring these patients.  ",,

If the patient states that he does not want to know about the prognosis, the most appropriate response is to ask if he would like to talk again at another time. The physician may be regarded as rude, cruel, or uncaring if he persists in providing information that the patient is not ready to hear. In addition, the patient is more at risk for feelings of hopelessness, depression, or anxiety if he is not psychologically ready to hear a bad prognosis. Once the patient verbalizes a readiness to discuss the prognosis, specific information can be provided, focusing on both the positive and negative aspects of the situation. It is not appropriate to discuss the case with the patient's wife, unless he specifically requests she be a proxy to receive the information. Referrals to either a support group or an oncologist should be deferred until the information has been discussed with the patient.  ",,

Which one of the following diagnoses characterizes her unexplained physical symptoms?",Somatization disorder,Conversion disorder,Hypochondriasis,Malingering,,,4,"This patient most likely is malingering, which is to purposefully feign physical symptoms for external gain. Factitious disorder involves adopting physical symptoms for unconscious internal gain, such as deriving comfort from taking on the role of being sick. Somatization disorder is related to numerous unexplained physical symptoms that last for several years and typically begin before 30 years of age. Conversion disorder involves a single voluntary motor or sensory dysfunction suggestive of a neurologic condition, but not conforming to any known anatomic pathways or physiologic mechanisms.",,

5555,3,PMCH,Which one of the following would be the most effective monotherapy for alcohol withdrawal syndrome?,Clonidine (Catapres),Phenytoin (Dilantin),Atenolol (Tenormin),Phenobarbital,Chlordiazepoxide (Librium),,5,"Alcohol withdrawal syndrome encompasses a wide range of symptoms involving primarily the central nervous, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems, and is mediated by the abrupt removal of alcohol-enhanced GABA inhibition of excitatory glutamate receptors in the central nervous system. It generally is divided into three stages, based on severity and timeline; seizures may occur during any of these stages and may be the first sign of withdrawal. The ideal pharmacologic agent should provide not only safe sedation but also protection from seizures. Long-acting benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide have been shown to be superior to the other choices in numerous studies. Clonidine and atenolol have been found to be useful in symptom reduction but not in seizure prevention. Phenytoin would seem to offer protection from seizures, but studies have not consistently shown this to be the case. Phenobarbital, while effective, has a very narrow therapeutic window, making its use problematic.  ",,

Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody is recommended by rheumatologists to improve the specificity of testing for rheumatoid arthritis. Anti-CCP is more specific than rheumatoid factor, and may predict erosive disease more accurately. Antinuclear antibody has limited usefulness for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Sm antigen is useful to help diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus. Nonspecific changes in complement levels are seen in many rheumatologic disorders. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is useful in monitoring disease activity and the course of rheumatoid arthritis, but is not specific.  ",,

",Supportive care only,Inhaled corticosteroids,Ribavirin (Rebetol),Palivizumab (Synagis),Supplemental oxygen,,1,"This child has a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Supportive care is the mainstay of therapy. If the child can take in fluids by mouth and tolerate room air, outpatient management with close physician contact as needed is reasonable, especially in the absence of significant underlying risk factors. Routine use of corticosteroids is not recommended (SOR B). Although up to 60% of infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis receive corticosteroid therapy, studies have not provided sufficient evidence to support their use. Inhaled corticosteroids have not been shown to be beneficial, and the safety of high doses in infants is unclear. Supplemental oxygen should be administered if functional oxygen saturation (SpO ) persistently falls below 90% and can be discontinued when an adequate level returns (SOR C). Antiviral therapy for RSV bronchiolitis is controversial because of its marginal benefit, cumbersome delivery, potential risk to caregivers, and high cost (SOR B). Studies of ribavirin in patients with bronchiolitis have produced inconsistent findings. Palivizumab is a preventive measure, and is not used for treatment of the active disease. It may be considered in select infants and children with prematurity, chronic lung disease of prematurity, or congenital heart disease (SOR A). If used, it should be administered intramuscularly in five monthly doses of 15 mg/kg, usually beginning in November or December (SOR C).  ",,

A chest film shows a loss of markings along the right lung margins, involving about 10%15% of the lung space. The mediastinum has not shifted. The best INITIAL treatment would be: ",strict bed rest,oxygen supplementation and close observation,decompression of the chest by insertion of a large-bore intravenous catheter into the right second intercostal space at the midclavicular line,immediate chest tube insertion using a water seal,thoracotomy for wedge resection of pulmonary blebs,,2,A small spontaneous pneumothorax involving less than 15%20% of lung volume can be managed by administering oxygen and observing the patient. The pneumothorax will usually resorb in about 10 days if no ongoing air leak is present. Oxygen lowers the pressure gradient for nitrogen and favors transfer of gas from the pleural space to the capillaries. Decompression with anterior placement of an intravenous catheter is usually reserved for tension pneumothorax. Chest tube placement is used if observation is not successful or for larger pneumothoraces. Strict bed rest is not indicated.,,

The headaches are throbbing in character and last for 13 hours, often causing her to leave work early. Relief is sometimes obtained with simple analgesics, but more often with sleep or the passage of time. On the basis of this history alone, the most likely diagnosis is: ",sinusitis,a brain tumor,muscle tension headache,cluster headache,migraine headache,,5,"Migraine is the most likely diagnosis in this scenario, because the patient is young and female; the headaches are unilateral, infrequent, and throbbing; the headaches are associated with nausea and vomiting; and sleep offers relief. Symptoms of sinusitis usually include fever, facial pain, and a purulent nasal discharge. The pain of cerebral tumor tends to occur daily and becomes more frequent and severe with time. Furthermore, the prevalence of brain tumor is far less than that of migraine. The pain of muscle tension headache is described as a pressure or band-like tightening, often in a circumferential or cap distribution. This headache also has a pattern of daily persistence, often continuing day and night for long periods of time.

However, axillosubclavian vein thrombosis (ASVT) is becoming more frequent with the increased use of indwelling subclavian vein catheters. Spontaneous ASVT (not catheter related) is seen most commonly in young, healthy individuals. The most common associated etiologic factor is the presence of a compressive anomaly in the thoracic outlet. These anomalies are often bilateral, and the other upper extremity at similar risk for thrombosis. While a hypercoagulable state also may contribute to the thrombosis, it is much less common. Budd-Chiari syndrome refers to thrombosis in the intrahepatic, suprahepatic, or hepatic veins. It is not commonly associated with spontaneous upper-extremity thrombosis.  ",,

He recently started jogging 2 miles a day to try to lose weight, but has not changed his diet and says he drinks 4 cans of beer every night. The pain has developed gradually over the last 2 weeks and is worse after running. An examination shows a normal foot with tenderness and swelling of the medial plantar aspect of the left first metatarsophalangeal joint. Passive dorsiflexion of the toe causes pain in that area. Plantar flexion produces no discomfort, and no numbness can be appreciated. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  ",Sesamoid fracture,Gout,Morton's neuroma,Cellulitis,,,1,"Pain involving the big toe is a common problem. The first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint has two sesamoid bones, and injuries to these bones account for 12% of big-toe injuries. Overuse, a sharp blow, and sudden dorsiflexion are the most common mechanisms of injury. Gout commonly involves the first MTP joint, but the onset is sudden, with warmth, redness, and swelling, and pain on movement of the joint is common. Morton's neuroma commonly causes numbness involving the digital nerve in the area, and usually is caused by the nerve being pinched between metatarsal heads in the center of the foot. Cellulitis of the foot is common, and can result from inoculation through a subtle crack in the skin. However, there would be redness and swelling, and the process is usually more generalized. Sesamoiditis is often hard to differentiate from a true sesamoid fracture. Radiographs should be obtained, but at times they are nondiagnostic. Treatment, fortunately, is similar, unless the fracture is open or widely displaced. Limiting weight bearing and flexion to control discomfort is the first step. More complex treatments may be needed if the problem does not resolve in 4&ndash;6 weeks.  ",,

Brief psychotic disorder is characterized by the presence of delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, or grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior lasting at least 1 day but less than 1 month. Delirium may present with psychotic symptoms but is the direct physiologic consequence of a general medical condition and usually has a much shorter course. Mood disorders with psychotic features can be ruled out if no major depressive, manic, or mixed episodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms, or if the duration of mood disturbance is brief compared to the overall duration of active and residual symptoms.

Characteristic findings include the absence of primary skin lesions and elevation of serum levels of total bile acids. The most specific and sensitive marker of ICP is total serum bile acid (BA) levels greater than 10 micromol/L. In addition to the elevation in serum BA levels, the cholic acid level is significantly increased and the chenodeoxycholic acid level is mildly increased, leading to elevation in the cholic/chenodeoxycholic acid level ratio. The elevation of aminotransferases associated with ICP varies from a mild increase to a 10- to 25-fold increase.Total bilirubin levels are also increased but usually the values are less than 5 mg/dL. Alkaline phosphatase (AP) is elevated in ICP up to 4-fold, but this is not helpful for diagnosis of the disorder since AP is elevated in pregnancy due to production by the placenta.

5597,6,Surgery,A 32-year-old farmer comes to your office because of an upper respiratory infection. While he is there he points out a lesion on his forearm that he first noted approximately 1 year ago. It is a 1-cm asymmetric nodule with an irregular border and variations in color from black to blue. The patient says that it itches and has been enlarging for the past 2 months. He says he is so busy that he is not sure when he can return to have it taken care of. In such cases the best approach would be to,perform a punch biopsy and have the patient return if the biopsy indicates pathology,perform a shave biopsy and recheck in 2 months for signs of recurrence,use electrocautery to destroy the lesion and the surrounding tissue,perform an elliptical excision as soon as possible,freeze the site with liquid nitrogen,,4,"Despite this individual's busy schedule, he has a potentially life-threatening problem that needs proper diagnosis and treatment. Though an excisional biopsy takes longer, it is the procedure of choice when melanoma is suspected. After removal and diagnosis, prompt referral is essential for further evaluation and therapy. A shave biopsy should never be done for suspected melanoma, as this is likely to transect the lesion and destroy evidence concerning its depth, thus making it difficult to assess the prognosis. A punch biopsy should be used only with discretion when the lesion is too large for complete excision, or if substantial disfigurement would occur. Since this may not actually retrieve cancerous tissue from an unsampled area of a large lesion that might be malignant, it would be safest to refer such patients. Neither cryotherapy nor electrocautery should be used for a suspected melanoma.",,
5598,4,Pediatrics,"A 3-week-old male is brought to your office because of a sudden onset of bilious vomiting of several hours' duration. He is irritable and refuses to breastfeed, but stools have been normal. He was delivered at term after a normal pregnancy, and has had no health problems to date. A physical examination shows a fussy child with a distended abdomen. Radiography of the abdomen shows a &ldquo;double bubble&rdquo; sign. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ",Infantile colic,Necrotizing enterocolitis,Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis,Intussusception,Midgut volvulus,,5,"Volvulus may present in one of three ways: as a sudden onset of bilious vomiting and abdominal pain in a neonate; as a history of &ldquo;feeding problems&rdquo; with bilious vomiting that appears to be a bowel obstruction; or less commonly, as failure to thrive with severe feeding intolerance. The classic finding on abdominal plain films is the &ldquo;double bubble&rdquo; sign, which shows a paucity of gas (airless abdomen) with two air bubbles, one in the stomach and one in the duodenum. However, the plain film can be entirely normal. The upper gastrointestinal contrast study is considered the gold standard for diagnosing volvulus. Infantile colic usually begins during the second week of life and typically occurs in the evening. It is characterized by screaming episodes and a distended or tight abdomen. Its etiology has yet to be determined. There are no abnormalities on physical examination and ancillary studies, and symptoms usually resolve spontaneously around 12 weeks of age. Necrotizing enterocolitis is typically seen in the distressed neonate in the intensive-care nursery, but it may occasionally be seen in the healthy neonate within the first 2 weeks of life. The child will appear ill, with symptoms including irritability, poor feeding, a distended abdomen, and bloody stools. Abdominal plain films will show pneumatosis intestinalis, caused by gas in the intestinal wall, which is diagnostic of the condition. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is a narrowing of the pyloric canal caused by hypertrophy of the musculature. It usually presents during the third to fifth weeks of life. Projectile vomiting after feeding, weight loss, and dehydration are common. The vomitus is always nonbilious, because the obstruction is proximal to the duodenum. If a small olive-size mass cannot be felt in the right upper or middle quadrant, ultrasonography will confirm the diagnosis. Intussusception is seen most frequently between the ages of 3 months and 5 years, with 60% of cases occurring in the first year and a peak incidence at 6&ndash;11 months of age. The disorder occurs predominantly in males. The classic triad of intermittent colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody, mucous stools is encountered in only 20%&ndash;40% of cases. At least two of these findings will be present in approximately 60% of patients. The abdomen may be distended and tender, and there may be an elongated mass in the right upper or lower quadrants. Rectal examination may reveal either occult blood or frankly bloody, foul-smelling stool, classically described as &ldquo;currant jelly.&rdquo; An air enema using fluoroscopic guidance is useful for both diagnosis and treatment.

The review found eight trials, five of which were conducted. Two of the RCTs were sufficiently powered to show a difference in pregnancy rates. No study showed that giving advance EC reduced pregnancy rates on a population level. However, women who were provided with advance EC took the pills an average of approximately 15 hours sooner than women without advance access. Five studies that reported on contraception use did not show a difference in type or frequency of regular contraception use among women who were provided advance EC. Women randomized to the advance EC groups were 2.5 times more likely to use EC once, and 4 times more likely to use it 2 or more times, compared to those without advance access. Three studies reported rates of sexually transmitted infection and none found differences between the advance and standard access EC groups. Six studies reported rates of unprotected sexual intercourse and found no difference. The Cochrane review concludes that advance access to EC appears to be safe, but does not reduce pregnancy on a population level. However, advance provision might be beneficial because it increases the speed and frequency of EC use.  ",,

Continuous oxygen has been shown to improve overall mortality and endurance in patients with an oxygen saturation of 88% or less, but has not been shown to improve quality of life in those with mild hypoxemia or if used only at night. Oral prednisone has been shown to be effective when used to treat acute exacerbations, but when used on a chronic basis it is no more effective than corticosteroid inhalers. Chronic oral prednisone is also associated with significant side effects, and therefore is not generally recommended.

He is aware that tight control of his blood glucose will help prevent the progression of renal disease, but wants to know what else he can do to preserve renal function. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate recommendation for this patient? ",Add an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB),Maintain blood pressure at 140/90 mm Hg or less,"Follow a high-protein, low-fat diet",Use erythropoietin therapy to keep the hemoglobin level above 14 g/dL,Add a calcium channel blocker,,1,"There are several strategies for slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease to end-stage renal disease, which requires either a renal transplant or dialysis. ACE inhibitors have been shown to be renoprotective by preventing the progression of diabetic nephropathy. There also is data showing that angiotensin receptor blockers probably are as effective as ACE inhibitors. Combining the two can further retard the progress of chronic kidney disease, but with the caveat that the two medications can increase the risk of hyperkalemia in a patient with impaired renal function, and the combination confers a higher mortality risk than either agent alone. In addition to tight glucose control, cessation of smoking, weight control, and treatment of hyperlipidemia, patients should strive to control hypertension. If proteinuria is less than 1 g/day, then the blood pressure goal should be 130/80 mm Hg; however, if proteinuria is more than 1 g/day, some authorities recommend a goal of 125/75 mm Hg. While good control of blood pressure is ideal, calcium channel blockers (especially the dihydropyridine class) should be used only if necessary, because they have been associated with a more rapid decline of glomerular filtration rate. Recent studies have shown that patients on a low-protein diet have a slower rate of deterioration in renal status. The recommended restriction is 0.60.8 g/kg/day. Anemia of chronic disease is a manifestation of chronic renal disorder. Although erythropoietin therapy may not prevent progression, it does improve survival and quality of life.  ",,

",Diagnose type 2 diabetes mellitus and begin diet and exercise therapy,Begin an oral hypoglycemic agent,Order a glucose tolerance test,Tell the patient that she has impaired glucose homeostasis but is not diabetic,,,1,"The criteria for diagnosing diabetes mellitus include any one of the following: symptoms of diabetes (polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss) plus a casual glucose level 200 mg/dL; a fasting plasma glucose level 126 mg/dL; or a 2-hour postprandial glucose level 200 mg/dL after a 75-gram glucose load. In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia the test must be repeated on a different day. The criteria for impaired glucose homeostasis include either a fasting glucose level of 100125 mg/dL (impaired fasting glucose) or a 2-hour glucose level of 140199 mg/dL on an oral glucose tolerance test. Normal values are now considered 100 mg/dL for fasting glucose and 140 mg/dL for the 2-hour glucose level on an oral glucose tolerance test.  ",,
5624,1,Medicine,"A 60-year-old male with a right-sided pleural effusion undergoes thoracentesis. Analysis of the pleural fluid reveals a protein level of 2.0 g/dL and an LDH level of 70 U/L. His serum protein level is 7.0 g/dL (N 6.0&ndash;8.3) and his serum LDH level is 200 U/L (N 100&ndash;105). Based on these findings, which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ",Heart failure,Pulmonary embolism,Tuberculous pleurisy,Malignancy,Bacterial pneumonia,,1,"Pleural effusions may be exudates or transudates. The distinction is important for an accurate diagnosis and to help determine what further evaluations may be necessary. Light's criteria use ratios of fluid/serum values for protein and LDH. Pleural fluid/serum ratios greater than 0.6 for LDH and 0.5 for protein are indicative of exudates. In the scenario presented, both ratios are approximately 0.3; therefore, the fluid is a transudate. The list of causes for transudates is much shorter than for exudates. The vast majority of transudates are due to heart failure, with cirrhosis being the next most common cause. Once there is reasonable certainty that the fluid is a transudate, additional studies usually are not necessary. The other conditions listed result in exudative pleural effusions.  ",,

Which one of the following would most likely require a significant dosage adjustment from the standard protocol? ,Enoxaparin (Lovenox),Metoprolol (Lopressor),Carvedilol (Coreg),Clopidogrel (Plavix),Tenecteplase (TNKase),,1,"Enoxaparin is eliminated mostly by the kidneys. When it is used in patients with severe renal impairment the dosage must be significantly reduced. For some indications the dose normally given every 12 hours is given only every 24 hours. Although some -blockers require a dosage adjustment, metoprolol and carvedilol are metabolized by the liver and do not require dosage adjustment in patients with renal failure. Clopidogrel is currently recommended at the standard dosage for patients with renal failure and acute coronary syndrome. Thrombolytics are given at the standard dosage in renal failure, although hemorrhagic complications are increased.  ",,

This patient presented with mild dehydration and normal laboratory values. Although he is improving clinically, his laboratory values show multiple unexpected results. The most noticeable is the severely elevated glucose, because he has no history of diabetes mellitus or use of medications that could cause this effect. Similarly, the elevated potassium and decreased sodium suggest profound electrolyte abnormalities. Most likely, the laboratory technician drew blood from the patient's indwelling port without discarding the first several milliliters. Thus, the blood was contaminated with intravenous fluids, resulting in the erroneous results. A repeat blood test from a peripheral vein should give more accurate results.",,
5630,5,Psychiatry,A 76-year-old male has psychosis secondary to dementia associated with Parkinson's disease. After exhausting all other options you decide to prescribe an antipsychotic agent. Which one of the following would be the best choice in this situation?,Haloperidol,Olanzapine,Risperidone,Quetiapine,Aripiprazole,,4,"Antipsychotics are indicated when other efforts to treat psychosis or agitation have failed or if antiparkinsonian medications cannot be reduced without sacrificing motor function. Importantly, they enable increases in antiparkinsonian medications. Since &ldquo;typical&rdquo; antipsychotics block dopamine D2 receptors and lead to increased parkinsonism, only &ldquo;atypical&rdquo; antipsychotics with a low potential for inducing parkinsonism (rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremor) are used. Among those currently available (clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole), only quetiapine and clozapine are consistently recommended. Clozapine is currently the gold standard of antipsychotic agents in PD given its demonstrated safety and efficacy in controlled trials without worsening parkinsonian symptoms. Sedation or confusion can occur at low doses in this fragile population and most patients respond to &lt;50 mg/day, though some require higher doses or an additional low dose in the mornings. The most common side effects are sedation, orthostasis, confusion, and drooling. Weekly phlebotomy is required to monitor for potential agranulocytosis. Any inconvenience of this is offset by therapeutic benefits.Quetiapine is a common first choice because it can be used without the risk of agranulocytosis and weekly blood monitoring. However, quetiapine has not been subject to controlled trials. Its safety and efficacy profile in open-label studies is favorable, but inadequate symptom control or increased parkinsonism or motor fluctuations can occur. Lower doses are used initially because patients with hypotension or orthostasis may not tolerate higher doses. Sedation and confusion are common side effects, but a recent open-label study showed improved cognitive functioning on quetiapine.&gt;typical antipsychotics, namely haloperidol, which is used to treat agitation or delirium in non-PD patients, are not recommended as they induce severe parkinsonism.&gt;initial open-label studies of olanzapine were favorable in terms of effectiveness and safety, but this was not shown in controlled trials. It may also be associated with worsening of parkinsonian symptoms&gt;risperidone is an effective antipsychotic, but is poorly tolerated in PD, even at doses &lt;1 mg/day. &gt;effects of aripiprazole on psychosis in PD are varied, and some patients have worse motor function.

5632,1,Medicine,A 35-year-old male with a previous history of kidney stones presents with symptoms consistent with a recurrence of this problem. The initial workup reveals elevated serum calcium. Which one of the following tests would be most appropriate at this point? ,Serum calcitonin,24-hour urine for calcium and phosphate,Serum phosphate and magnesium,Serum parathyroid hormone,Spot urine for microalbumin,,4,"A patient with a recurrent kidney stone and an elevated serum calcium level most likely has hyperparathyroidism, and a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level would be appropriate. Elevated PTH is caused by a single parathyroid adenoma in approximately 80% of cases. The resultant hypercalcemia is often discovered in asymptomatic persons having laboratory work for other reasons. An elevated PTH by immunoassay confirms the diagnosis. In the past, tests based on renal responses to elevated PTH were used to make the diagnosis. These included blood phosphate, chloride, and magnesium, as well as urinary or nephrogenous cyclic adenosine monophosphate. These tests are not specific for this problem, however, and are therefore not cost-effective. Serum calcitonin levels have no practical clinical use.",,

The first dose should be given between 6 and 12 weeks of age, with additional doses given at 4- to 10-week intervals. The vaccine cannot be initiated after 12 weeks of age and should not be administered after 32 weeks of age. The first rotavirus vaccine was taken off the market in 1999 after an increased risk of intussusception was noted in infants when the first dose of the vaccine was given after 12 weeks of age. Because of this, the two vaccines licensed in 2006 carry the recommendation that the vaccine not be initiated in infants over 12 weeks of age.

",Test for food allergies,Begin low-dose lorazepam (Ativan),Begin a 6-week trial of a proton pump inhibitor,Schedule frequent office visits,,,4,"Somatization disorders should be considered in patients who have a history of various complaints over a several-year period that involve multiple organ systems. There is no test to confirm this diagnosis. It is often intertwined in other psychiatric problems, including anxiety disorder, personality disorder, and depression. Treatment includes testing to make sure that there is nothing physically wrong, while building a trusting relationship with the patient. Once this is accomplished, it is reasonable to discuss the disorder with the patient. Cognitive therapy has been shown to be of value, as well as regularly scheduled office visits for monitoring and support. Medicines for coexisting psychiatric problems also are of benefit. In addition, referral for psychiatric consultation may be worthwhile. Food allergies can cause a variety of symptoms, but usually not to the extent seen with this patient, and testing for this might confuse the issue. Lorazepam may help the symptoms if there is a coexisting anxiety disorder, but it will not address the underlying problem.

Primary prevention targets individuals who may be at risk to develop a medical condition and intervenes to prevent the onset of that condition (e.g., childhood vaccination programs, water fluoridation, antismoking programs, and education about safe sex). Secondary prevention targets individuals who have developed an asymptomatic disease and institutes treatment to prevent complications (e.g., routine Papanicolaou smears, and screening for hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia). Tertiary prevention targets individuals with a known disease, with the goal of limiting or preventing future complications (e.g., screening diabetics for microalbuminuria, rigorous treatment of diabetes mellitus, and postmyocardial infarction prophylaxis with -blockers and aspirin).",,

A physical examination is normal except for unilateral ptosis and 4/5 proximal weakness of both arms. Breath sounds are generally decreased. Routine blood tests, including TSH and creatine kinase levels, are normal. A chest radiograph and an MRI of the brain and cervical spine are also normal.

Myasthenia gravis is part of the differential diagnosis for sudden neurologic weakness, and Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome must also be considered in this patient. Multiple sclerosis would not result in respiratory compromise. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune neuromuscular disease characterized by varying degrees of skeletal muscle weakness. Symptoms, which vary in type and severity, may include ptosis of one or both eyelids; blurred vision; diplopia; unstable gait; weakness in the arms, hands, fingers, legs, and neck; difficulty swallowing; shortness of breath; and impaired speech (dysarthria). In most cases, the first noticeable symptom is weakness of the eye muscles. Muscles that control respiration and neck and limb movements may also be affected. Symptoms typically worsen through the day or as the muscles are repetitively used, and improve with rest. Fibromyalgia does not produce objective neurologic findings, and Sheehan's syndrome would not cause a localized neurologic deficit. In addition, the TSH level would be low or zero, and the MRI of the brain would be abnormal. An MRI of the brain would also be abnormal if stroke symptoms had been present for 2 weeks.

The ABI is the ratio of systolic blood pressure measured in the ankle to systolic pressure using the standard brachial measurement. A ratio of 0.91.2 is considered normal. Severe disease is defined as a ratio 0.50.

Which one of the following would best correlate with a diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis? ,Fractional excretion of sodium 1%,Elevated urine osmolality,Elevated serum glucose,Elevated BUN,Low plasma arginine vasopressin,,2,"The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD, formerly SIADH) is related to a variety of pulmonary and central nervous system disorders in which hyponatremia and hypo-osmolality are paradoxically associated with an inappropriately concentrated urine. Most, but not all, cases are associated with increased levels of the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP). For a diagnosis of SIAD to be made, the patient must be euvolemic and not on diuretics (within 2448 hours), and the urine osmolality must be high in conjunction with both low serum sodium and low osmolality. The BUN is normal or low and the fractional excretion of sodium is 1%. Fluid restriction (800 cc/24 hours) over several days will correct the hyponatremia/hypo-osmolality, but definitive treatment requires eliminating the underlying cause, if possible. In the case of severe, acute hyponatremia with symptoms (e.g., confusion, obtundation, seizures), hypertonic (3%) saline can be slowly infused intravenously but can have dangerous neurologic side effects. Elevated serum glucose levels give rise to a factitious hyponatremia, but not SIAD.  ",,

",Avascular necrosis of the femoral head (Legg-Calv-Perthes disease),Osteosarcoma,Meralgia paresthetica,Pauciarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,Slipped capital femoral epiphysis,,5,"This is a classic presentation for slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) in an adolescent male who has probably had a recent growth spurt. Pain with activity is the most common presenting symptom, as opposed to the nighttime pain that is typical of malignancy. Obese males are affected more often. The pain is typically in the anterior thigh, but in a high percentage of patients the pain may be referred to the knee, lower leg, or foot. Limited internal rotation of the hip, especially with the hip in 90 flexion, is a reliable and specific finding for SCFE and should be looked for in all adolescents with hip, thigh, or knee pain. Meralgia paresthetica is pain in the thigh related to entrapment of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, often attributed to excessively tight clothing. Legg-Calv-Perthes disease (avascular or aseptic necrosis of the femoral head) is more likely to occur between the ages of 4 and 8 years.

","Use disciplinary measures to force the child to eat a healthy breakfast, lunch, and dinner",Leave the child in the high chair until he has eaten all of the healthy meal presented,Play feeding games to encourage consumption of healthy meals or snacks,Skip the next meal if the child refuses to eat,"Provide healthy foods for all meals and snacks, and end the meal if the child refuses to eat",,5,"It is estimated that 3%10% of infants and toddlers refuse to eat according to their caregivers. Unlike other feeding problems such as colic, this problem tends to persist without intervention. It is recommended that caregivers establish food rules, such as healthy scheduled meals and snacks, and apply them consistently. Parents should control what, when, and where children are being fed, whereas children should control how much they eat at any given time in accordance with physiologic signals of hunger and fullness. No food or drinks other than water should be offered between meals or snacks. Food should not be offered as a reward or present. Parents can be reassured that a normal child will learn to eat enough to prevent starvation. If malnutrition does occur, a search for a physical or mental abnormality should be sought.",,
5651,1,Medicine,"An 83-year-old female presents with pain, swelling, and erythema of her left knee, as well as some swelling and pain in her right wrist. She first noticed this problem last night before going to bed. She is generally healthy and takes no medications. She has not been sexually active since being widowed 15 years ago, and she currently lives with her sister. She states that she developed pain and swelling in her left ankle 2 years ago that lasted only a couple of days and resolved spontaneously. Blood testing shows a very elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate but a normal rheumatoid factor and uric acid level. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis? ",Gonococcal arthritis,Gout,Pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate disease),Rheumatoid arthritis,Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament,,3,"Acute monoarthritis in adults is most commonly caused by infection, trauma, or crystal deposition. Rheumatoid arthritis infrequently presents as monoarthritis, and more often has a subacute course with multiple, symmetric joints involved. Although osteoporosis may result in a fracture of the knee joint without trauma, there is no reason to believe that this patient has a torn anterior cruciate ligament. Gonococcal arthritis is one of the most common causes of septic arthritis, but is highly unlikely in this elderly, sexually inactive patient. Nongonococcal septic arthritis (especially due to staphylococcal and streptococcal bacteria) is still a consideration and should be ruled out by aspiration of fluid to be sent for culture. This patient's presentation is most consistent with pseudogout. Having a normal uric acid level suggests against gout, but does not rule it out. Also, gout is seven times more likely to be seen in males, whereas pseudogout is 1.5 times more frequent in females. Pseudogout most often affects the elderly, and usually affects the knee, wrist, and ankle. Gout presents most commonly in the first metatarsophalangeal joint and insteps of the feet, but also can occur in the knee, wrist, finger, and olecranon bursa. Differentiating between gout and pseudogout can be difficult and is best done by analysis of joint fluid. In patients with gout, this fluid contains highly negative birefringent, needle-shaped urate crystals, whereas in pseudogout the fluid contains rhomboid-shaped, weakly positive birefringent calcium pyrophosphate crystals.

5652,3,PMCH,Which one of the following is true about end-of-life care?,Physicians underestimate life expectancies,Most physicians are comfortable with their level of education in palliative care and pain control,Most patients who qualify for hospice care receive services early in the course of their illness,Most terminal patients want their lives prolonged as much as possible,Most terminal patients express a desire for a sense of control,,5,"End-of-life issues are a challenge to primary care physicians because of concerns about a lack of education in pain control and palliative care. Trying to determine the prognosis of patients is difficult, and even with established criteria, the estimated prognosis is right only 50% of the time. There is a tendency for most physicians to overestimate life expectancy in a terminal patient. Most patients who are appropriate candidates for hospice care do not receive referrals until late in their illness, if at all. Patients at the end of life have five main areas of concern: control of pain and other symptoms; avoiding a prolongation of the dying process; having a sense of control; relieving burdens on family and loved ones; and strengthening relationships with family and friends.

The most likely diagnosis is: ",Herpangina,"Hand, foot, and mouth disease",Aphthous stomatitis,Herpetic gingivostomatitis,Streptococcal pharyngitis,,2,"Hand, foot, and mouth disease is a mild infection occurring in young children, and is caused by coxsackievirus A16, or occasionally by other strains of coxsackie- or enterovirus. In addition to the oral lesions, vesicular lesions may occur on the feet and nonvesicular lesions may occur on the buttocks. A low-grade fever may also develop. Herpangina is also caused by coxsackieviruses, but it is a more severe illness characterized by severe sore throat and vesiculo-ulcerative lesions limited to the tonsillar pillars, soft palate, and uvula, and occasionally the posterior oropharynx. Temperatures can range to as high as 41C (106F). The etiology of aphthous stomatitis is multifactorial, and it may be due to a number of conditions. Systemic signs, such as fever, are generally absent. Lesions are randomly distributed. Herpetic gingivostomatitis also causes randomly distributed oral ulcers, but it is a more severe illness, regularly accompanied by a higher fever, and is extremely painful. Streptococcal pharyngitis is rarely accompanied by ulceration except in agranulocytic patients.",,

This pattern is a warning sign and is associated with increasing fetal compromise, worsening fetal acidosis, fetal central nervous system depression, and/or direct myocardial hypoxia. Early decelerations are thought to result from vagus nerve response to fetal head compression, and are not associated with increased fetal mortality or morbidity.

","Order a CBC, chemistry panel, stool for occult blood, and TSH",Refer for immediate colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy,"Schedule CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis",Start megestrol (Megace) to promote weight gain,Discontinue mirtazapine,,1,"There should be a rational approach to evaluating weight loss in an elderly patient. The workup should be directed by findings in the history and physical examination, with special emphasis given to neurologic and psychosocial aspects. Unless the history or physical examination point in a specific direction, standard tests should be performed first, including a CBC, chemistry panel, stool for occult blood, and TSH level. Although the etiology of unintentional weight loss in the elderly is malignancy in 16%36% of such cases, specific tests are not indicated before CT. Medications, including SSRIs, NSAIDs, bupropion, digoxin, and metformin can cause weight loss; however, amitriptyline often leads to weight gain. Mirtazapine has been shown to increase appetite and promote weight gain. Megestrol has been used successfully to treat cachexia in patients with AIDS or cancer. When given in a dosage of at least 320 mg/day, megestrol has produced weight gain, but side effects of edema, constipation, and delirium may limit its usefulness. Lower dosages may be effective for stimulating weight gain in frail elderly patients, although this approach needs to be tested in randomized, controlled trials. In the patient described, a workup seeking the etiology of the weight loss should begin promptly.  ",,

These patients are at high risk for developing diabetes mellitus later in life. Prediabetes is associated with metabolic syndrome, and weight loss, exercise, and certain pharmacologic agents have been shown to prevent or delay the subsequent development of diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is diagnosed in three ways: symptoms of diabetes (polyuria, polydipsia, unexplained weight loss) plus a random plasma glucose level 200 mg/dL; a fasting plasma glucose level 126 mg/dL; or a glucose level 200 mg/dL on a 2-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. It is important to note that in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia the diagnosis must be confirmed by repeat testing on a subsequent day. Once the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed, further testing is needed to differentiate between type 1, type 2, and maturity-onset diabetes of youth.  ",,

She has stridor, with mild substernal retractions only when her temperature was taken. Which one of the following would be most appropriate at this point? ","Dexamethasone, 0.6 mg/kg orally or intramuscularly as a single dose",Guaifenesin/pseudoephedrine elixir orally until symptoms improve,Azithromycin (Zithromax) orally for 5 days,"Observation in the clinic, and if there is improvement, a 5-day course of dexamethasone",,,1,"Croup can be classified as spasmodic croup, laryngotracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis (LTB), laryngotracheobroncheopneumonia (LTBP), or laryngeal diphtheria. Mild croup is manifested by an occasional barking cough with no stridor at rest, and mild or absent intercostal retractions. Moderate croup presents with a more frequent barking cough, stridor with suprasternal and sternal retractions at rest, but no agitation. Severe croup includes more prominent inspiratory and expiratory stridor with agitation and distress. There is good evidence that corticosteroids produce significant improvement. The regimens studied most frequently have consisted of single-dose dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg orally or intramuscularly), with some studies including up to four more doses over a 2-day period. Longer courses of corticosteroids have not proven to be more effective and may be harmful, leading to secondary infections. Racemic epinephrine by nebulization is indicated in severe croup. Antitussives and decongestants have not been studied and are not recommended. Antibiotics are indicated in LTB and LTBP, which can be diagnosed on the basis of crackles and wheezing on examination, or by an abnormal chest radiograph. Laryngotracheitis can sometimes be associated with a bacterial infection, but should be suspected only after a patient does not improve with corticosteroids and epinephrine.  ",,

Physicians don't worry about insufficient (or excessive) growth until a child's growth velocity has crossed at least two percentile lines (e.g., from above the 90th to below the 50th percentile). Additionally, if a child's weight, height, or head size is below the 5th percentile, they might also call them small for age. In that case, what's most important is to see if the growth points parallel the 5th percentile line (meaning growth velocity is normal) or if the child is falling further behind (which is more concerning).

In a hemodynamically unstable patient with a high-risk mechanism of injury and altered mental status, peritoneal lavage is the quickest, most reliable modality to determine whether there is a concomitant intra-abdominal injury requiring laparotomy. CT of the abdomen and contrast duodenography may complement lavage in stable patients with negative or equivocal lavage results, but in an unstable or uncooperative patient these studies are too time-consuming or require ill-advised sedation. Ultrasonography may also complement lavage in selected patients, but its usefulness is limited in the acute situation.

Many of the severe conditions may be ruled out through the history (hyaline membrane disease is unlikely in this full-term infant) and physical examination (choanal atresia may be ruled out at the bedside). After these initial steps are taken, a chest radiograph and laboratory studies will help rule out many urgent and life-threatening conditions, such as pneumothorax, pneumonia, severe anemia, sepsis, etc. An EKG is less helpful in determining causes since it cannot differentiate defects that cause cyanotic heart disease. Infusion of prostaglandin E1 should be started only if the condition is determined to be ductal dependent; this is not the case in this scenario.

Through public health efforts such as education, prevention and vaccination programs the incidence of these diseases began to fall.  This, along with social reforms and the advent of new technologies has led to an increase in life expectancy (LE).  In 1900, a person had a LE at birth of less than 50 years; the LE of a person at birth in 2011 is 80.7 years.  However, during the last hundred years, the incidence and prevalence rates of chronic disease have also risen dramatically.   Chronic illness including: cardiovascular diseases, cancers, pulmonary diseases, endocrine disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, diseases of the nervous system and sense organs, and mental illness cause tremendous human suffering and cost billions of dollars to the Canadian government.Combining direct medical costs ($38.9 billion) and indirect productivity losses ($54.4 billion), the total economic burden of the aforementioned chronic illness categories comes to more than $93 billion a year. This amounts to more than half of the total economic cost of illness in Canada, or 9% of the country's total gross domestic product.

The pathology is related to a reduction in estrogen levels (due to the degeneration of theca cells) and the resultant increase in FSH &amp; LH (due to a lack of negative inhibition).  Symptoms and sequelae of menopause can include: hot flushes, urogenital atrophy, osteoporosis, a reduction in breast size, skin thinning and mood or sleep disturbances.  They should be treated individually where possible.a)	Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is considered the first line treatment for symptoms of vasomotor instability (hot flushes, night sweats, sleep disturbances). Studies have shown an increased risk of breast cancer, heart disease, PE and stroke with HRT use.  In light of these results, HRT is not recommended for long-term use, except in limited circumstances where other therapeutic choices are found inadequate.  They should be prescribed at the lowest effective dose for the appropriate duration.b)	Estrogen cream (e.g. Premarin) is a local acting estrogen treatment which can relieve symptoms of urogenital atrophy such as painful intercourse (dyspareunia) and vaginal itching/dryness/bleeding.c)	Selective estrogen receptor modifiers (SERMs) mimic estrogen-effects on bones without affecting breast and uterine tissue, i.e. they don't increase the risk of breast or uterine cancer.  They are approved for the treatment of osteoporosis and breast cancer.d)	Referral for sex therapy counseling is a reasonable option to propose if initial or secondary treatments were ineffective and the couple was experiencing marital difficulties as a result.e)	Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been proposed as an alternative to hormonal therapy for breast cancer survivors.PEARL: Estrogen cream should be your first line of treatment for urogenital atrophy.",,

The lack of dyspnea is less suggestive of pneumothorax.  The normal CBC, serum chemistries, amylase, EKG and the negative cardiac enzymes do not necessarily rule out pancreatitis or MI; however, when you further consider the difference in blood pressures between arms (30 mmHg), and the widened mediastinum on x-ray, you should be leaning more towards aortic dissection in your differential.A definitive diagnosis would be made via CT or MRI.  Treatment includes the reduction of systolic blood pressure to 110 mmHg with B-blockade then maintenance with nitroprusside.  Surgical options will depend on the type of dissection, Stanford type A or B (a topic that will not be covered here).Acute pancreatitis (a) would typically produce elevated levels of amylase and lipase, leukocytosis, electrolyte imbalances, and an elevated CRP.  It would not demonstrate a widened mediastinum on x-ray; rather, a sentinel loop (or an isolated distended loop of bowel seen near the site of the injured viscus&mdash;usually in left hypochondrium) would more likely be seen on abdominal x-ray.Myocardial Infarction (b) would typically yield elevated cardiac enzymes and EKG changes (e.g. ST elevation).  Further investigation would include echo or angiography.  MI alone would not demonstrate a widened mediastinum on x-ray.  A patient with a pneumothorax (d) or tension pneumothorax (e) would present with dyspnea along with their chest pain (a history of trauma would also be likely for tension pneumothorax).   Generally, on x-ray, one hemithorax may seem darker (more radiolucent) than the other as the area beyond the collapsed lung will have no pulmonary vessel markings.  The pleural edge of the collapsed lung will be seen.  Occasionally, there will be a shift in the mediastinal structures.PEARL: Severe, sudden chest pain, blood pressure differences between arms and a widened mediastinum on x-ray should make you suspect aortic dissection.",,

Reticulocytes are immature RBC's; normally, approximately 2% of these reticulocytes will enter the bloodstream&mdash;eventually maturing into RBC's after a few days.  If the steady state of RBC production/destruction is disrupted by an increased loss of RBCs or by decreased production, then anemia will develop.  Increased loss of red blood cells may be due to acute or chronic bleeding or hemolysis. The body compensates for this loss by increasing the rate of RBC production. When this happens, the number and percentage of reticulocytes in the blood increases until a sufficient number of RBCs are present.

5877,1,Medicine,"A patient's hepatitis serology returns the following results: HBsAg+, AntiHBs-, HBeAg+, Anti-HBe-, Anti-HBc+ (IgM) You can tell her that: ",She has chronic active (high infectivity) hepatitis B,She has chronic inactive (low infectivity) hepatitis B,She is in recovery (non-infective),She has acute hepatitis B (infective),She is immune (non-infective),medicine44511.png,4,"Hepatitis serologyQuestions on hepatitis serology are notorious test favorites because they are confusing and require a good understanding of what the antigens and antibodies represent.  ApproachPatient's lab results: HBsAg+, AntiHBs-, HBeAg+, Anti-HBe-, Anti-HBc+ (IgM)Hepatitis serology results will tell us 3 things:  1) Whether or not the patient is infected; 2) How infectious the patient is; 3) Whether the infection, if present, is acute or chronic.1.	Is the patient infected?a.	HBsAg is the surface antigen found in the acute or carrier stages of infection which, if positive, indicates the patient is infective (see the dark red box below).  It may help to think of the s as standing for &ldquo;spread&rdquo; (i.e. infectious).   At this point, we have established that she is infective but not whether she is in the acute or chronic phase or how infectious a carrier she may be.b.	AntiHBs is the surface antibody, which, if positive, indicates immunity to hepatitis B from either exposure to the virus or from vaccination (see the green box below).  The surface antibody will usually not be positive if the surface antigen is positive. It is negative in this case which tells us the patient is not immune (eliminating answer options c and e).  We still need to determine whether the infection is acute or chronic and how infectious a carrier she may be.2.	How infectious is the patient?a.	HBeAg is the antigen found in the blood when the virus is actively replicating (see the red box below).  It may help to think of the e as for &ldquo;echo&rdquo; (i.e. repeat, replicate)   Our patient has this antigen present indicating that she is actively replicating virus and is highly infectious.i.	Here's a quick way you can tell you whether or not the patient is highly infectious: the letters &ldquo;s&rdquo; and &ldquo;e&rdquo; are in the word &ldquo;infectious&rdquo;.  If antigens HBsAg and HBeAg are present in the blood (positive), your patient is highly infectious (such as the one in this case)!  b.	Anti-HBe is the antibody produced in response to HBeAg.  It's presence in the blood indicates that: i) the person has been exposed to hepatitis B (as opposed to being immunized against it); and, ii) a person who was HBeAg positive has since developed immunity to this antigen and is no longer actively replicating virus.  In other words, if the patient has Anti-HBe in their blood and is HBsAg positive then they are infectious but less so than if they were Anti-HBe negative (see the blue box below).  Our patient is anti-HBe negative (and HBsAg &amp; HBeAg positive) so she has yet to develop an immune response and is clearly (highly) infectious.3.	Is it acute or chronic?a.	Anti-HBc is the antibody to the core antigen.  It tells us whether the infection is acute or chronic.  Remember that in general, IgM is the first antibody to respond to an antigen. It is followed by IgG (the secondary or mature) antibody response.  Thus, the presence of core antibody IgM, as in this case, indicates that her body has not had time to develop a mature response to the core antigen, i.e. it is an acute infection (eliminating answer options a and b).  Had IgG anti-HBc shown up instead, we would know that there was time to develop a mature IgG response, i.e. the patient had a chronic infection.  Remember IgM for &ldquo;Me first&rdquo;.Summary: Our patient is therefore infectious (&ldquo;s&rdquo; antigen for spread); actively replicating and therefore highly infectious (&ldquo;e&rdquo; antigen for echo); and, in the acute stages of infection (IgM for &ldquo;Me first&rdquo;); see the dotted orange box below.PEARLS: Remember antigen &ldquo;s&rdquo; for &ldquo;spread&rdquo; and &ldquo;e&rdquo; for &ldquo;echo&rdquo; (replicate).  Both s and e are found in the word &ldquo;infectious&rdquo;; IgM for &ldquo;Me first&rdquo; = acute.",,

This patient's fasciculations, decreased reflexes and negative Babinski are indicative of a lower motor neuron lesion.   Remember: &ldquo;You have to get Down Low to get to the Lower Motor Neuron&rdquo; (reflexes and muscle strength are Low, Down-going plantar reflex)UMN lesions (b) have the opposite effect causing hyperreflexia, spasticity and up-going plantar reflexes (positive Babinski).  The plantar reflex is a deep tendon reflex (of the L4, L5, S1 &amp; S2 nerve roots) which, if elicited, should never cause dorsiflexion, or an up-going foot (except in infants, as their corticospinal tracts have yet to develop).  If present, it indicates an upper motor neuron lesion within the corticospinal tract.Extrapyramidal lesions (c) would produce muscle rigidity, repetitive muscle movements, and/or involuntary movements (as seen in Parkinsonism).  Remember: &ldquo;Pyramids are rigid &amp; strong&rdquo; (rigidity and no muscle weakness)Both UMN and LMN involvement (option d) is found in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).  ALS is a disease that is characterized by symptoms of LMN lesions at first (e.g. fasciculations and weakness) which gradually progress to involve symptoms of UMN lesions (e.g. spasticity and hyperreflexia).

5879,1,Medicine,An elderly man is brought in to the ED by his wife in a semi-stuporous state.  She said he's been acting strangely since he fell out of bed a few days ago.  The results of his CT are shown below.This scan is suggestive of: ,Cerebellar atrophy,Frontal bone fracture,Subdural hematoma,Subarachnoid hemorrhage,Epidural hematoma,medicine64511.png|medicine74511.png,3,"Intracranial HemorrhageA subdural hematoma (SDH) collects in the space between the dura and arachnoid membrane.  It usually has a crescent shape lying between the skull and cerebral convexities (see dotted red crescents in Fig 1 &amp; 2). The SDH does not cross but may follow the contours of the falx or tentorium.  It also won't extend into the cortical sulci.  Hemorrhage originates from torn bridging veins (due to head injury) that drain the cerebral cortex, traverse the subdural and subarachnoid spaces, and enter the superior sagittal sinus.  Infants, the elderly and alcoholics are at increased risk.  Patients may complain of a loss of consciousness but will recover without relapse.  Symptoms include dizziness, nausea, altered mental status, seizures, personality changes or compromised vision and hearing.  This is an elderly patient with a history of a fall and altered mental status.  His CT (Fig 2) demonstrates a crescent shaped hematoma (SDH).  The pressure of the SDH has caused a midline shift (black arrow /blue dotted line) which is likely the reason for his altered mental status.  (e) An epidural hematoma (EDH) is located between the dura and the skull.   It tends to have a lenticular shape (biconvex) because of the firm attachment of the dura to the skull, particularly at the cranial sutures (see dotted green line in Fig 1).  It occasionally crosses the midline, and it is usually associated with an overlying skull fracture, which tears a meningeal artery.  Patients will present with a history of head trauma with loss of consciousness, then a lucid period, followed again by loss of consciousness.(d) A subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) collects within the subarachnoid space under the arachnoid membrane and invaginates into the cortical sulci and fissures (see solid purple line in Fig 1).  Aside from head injury, it may occur spontaneously (e.g. a ruptured cerebral aneurysm).  Patients will complain of a rapid onset, severe headache.  Other symptoms may include confusion, vomiting, altered mental status or seizures.Cerebellar atrophy (a) is caused by alcoholism or spinocerebellar disorder. It presents with ataxia and seizures.  The cerebellum cannot be appreciated from this CT slice.Frontal bone fractures (b) are usually the result of blunt or penetrating head injury.  The force required to fracture the frontal bone has been estimated as 100 times that of gravity, i.e. necessitating a high-energy impact (such as a head striking the dashboard during a car accident).  This patient has no such severe trauma history and his CT does not indicate any fractures.PEARL: Subdural hematomas are due to torn bridging veins and are crescent shaped on CT ",,
5880,1,Medicine,"A 25 year old man presents with sudden onset swelling and scrotal pain radiating to his flank. He describes the pain as 10/10 and unremitting except occasionally when he raises his scrotum.  There is purulent discharge coming from his urethra.  Vital signs are: T 38C, BP 140/80, HR 110, RR 16.   The most likely etiology for his condition is: ",Gonorrhea,Tuberculosis,Syphillis,Kidney stones,Testicular torsion,,1,"Epididymitis/orchitisThis is a two-step question.  First, you must determine what the diagnosis is.  The two most likely etiologies of sudden onset, constant, testicular pain with radiation and scrotal swelling are epididymitis/orchitis or testicular torsion.  When considering the patients fever and discharge one should be leaning more towards a diagnosis of epididymitis.  The partial relief of his pain with scrotal support (Prehn's sign) can be attributed to a relaxing of the tension on his inflamed spermatic cord; whereas, the pain from testicular torsion will not yield to scrotal support.  This sign, however, should not replace an U/S investigation, as torsion must be operated on within 6 hours.The second part of this question is to determine which of the 3 choices (a), (b) or (c) is the most likely infectious agent of epididymitis.  For men &lt; 35 years of age, gonorrhea or chlamydia are the most common infectious organisms leading to epididymitis.  In men &gt; 35, E. coli is most commonly associated.  Tuberculosis (a) and Syphilis (b) are very rare causes.Nephrolithiasis (d) presents with waxing and waning flank pain (which can radiate to the groin, testis or penis) and hematuria.  The pain is independent of scrotal support and the scrotum would not be swollen.PEARL: Gonorrhea/chlamydia are the most common causes of epididymitis in young men.",,

Symptoms can include abdominal pain, headaches, vomiting, confusion, muscle weakness, seizures, hair loss and anemia.A particularly vulnerable patient population are children younger than 6 years of age. Canadian homes, in particular those built prior to 1960, do contain lead paint so it is conceivable that lead dust from paint poses an on-going risk to children. The CDC recommends: 1) screening virtually all children for lead exposure at 12 and 24 months; 2) screening children at high risk every 6 months beginning at 6 months of age; and 3) using direct measurement of BPb (annual blood lead levels) rather than erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) to screen.PEARL: Lead poisoning presents with neurologic deficits, abdominal pain and microcytic anemia.",,
